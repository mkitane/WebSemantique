# Node Simple Router <img src="https://raw.github.com/sandy98/node-simple-router/master/test/public/img/router50.png" />
### Yet another minimalistic router for node.js 

# Getting started

## 
**Step 1: Install**

From Node Package Manager:

    npm install node-simple-router`</pre>

From source:

    git clone https://github.com/sandy98/node-simple-router


## 
**Step 2: Test**

    cd to your installation directory and run `npm test`
then point your browser to _http://localhost:8000_ and review the info
and above all, try the examples.


## 
**Step 3: Run your server**

You can roll your own, or use the sample server that NSR provides by means of the mk-server utility:

`mk-server js` will provide a barebones server (_server.js_)  with some example routes ready to run.

In order for this to work, you must have installed NSR global, like so:

   `sudo npm install -g node-simple-router`, or have the .bin directory of NSR in your path by whatever means you see fit.

Either case, the basic steps are the same:

#### Import 'http'

`var http = require('http');`

#### Import NSR

`var Router = require('node-simple-router');`

#### Instantiate the router

`var router = Router(); // may also be router = new Router();`

#### Add some routes

`router.get("/hello", function(request, response) {response.end("Hello, World!");});`

#### Create an http server using router as the handler

`var server = http.createServer(router);`

#### Finally, make it listen on your chosen port and you're in business

`server.listen(1234);`

### Rationale

Routing, in web app parlance, is about defining what code to execute when a given URL is invoked.
NSR takes care of the necessary plumbing to make that happen,
freeing the programmer of the cumbersome details, allowing her to focus on the problem domain.
#### How does it work?
As was stated in the lines above, it's not necessary to know <span class="nsr">NSR</span>
inner workings in order to be productive using it. Having said that, it is nevertheless useful to
have some insight on a couple of key aspects, fundamentally what could be called the <em>"request wrapping
mechanism"</em>.

When you feed <span class="nsr">NSR</span> with a url handling function, i.e. <code class="js">
router.get("/answertoall", function(request, response) {response.end("42");});</code>

what <span class="nsr">NSR</span>
does is to wrap that function into another, unnamed one, which has the primary mission of _"augmenting"_ the request
object and it stores said function in an array of url-handling functions, thus acting as a _middleware_ piece of code.
At run time, when a client invokes the matching URL, the "middleware" function will be called, which, after doing its trickery to "dress" the request object, will ultimately call the original url-handling function that was provided.
            
What does _"augmenting-dressing"_  the request object mean?

Well, basically, <span class="nsr">NSR</span> provides the request object with 3 properties:
            <ul>
              <li>**request.get** which is an object representation of the <dfn>query string</dfn></li>
              <li>**request.post** an object representation of what was posted, if anything</li>
              <li>**request.body** is the union of the two previous items</li>
            </ul>
            It should be pointed down that regardless the transmission method, <span class="nsr">NSR</span>
            takes the necessary steps to make all 3 of them true javascript objects with all that implies, JSON and all.
            Worst case is an empty object **{}**, no errors.
            So, you can use `request.get.whatever` for `router.get`,
            `request.post.whatever` for `router.post`, but in any case, if you don't care about request method,
            using `request.body.whatever` is a safe bet, most obviously useful if you do not know in advance
            the request method, for example: <code class="js">router.any("/threefold", function(request, response)
            {response.end((parseInt(request.body.number) * 3).toString();});</code>
         </p>
         <p>
             Wrapping up, you just got to remember **request.get, request.post** and **request.body**
             
And that's all there is about it.

### Options

NSR sticks to some conventions ("public" as directory name for static assets, etc),
which the programmer can override when instantiating the router, for instance:

    var router = new Router({static_route: __dirname + "/static"});
to change usage of the default "public" directory for static resources
            

List of default options:
            <p>
                <pre><code class="js">
                logging: true
                log: console.log
                static_route: "#{process.cwd()}/public"
                serve_static: true
                list_dir: true
                default_home: ['index.html', 'index.htm', 'default.htm']
                cgi_dir: "cgi-bin"
                serve_cgi: true
                serve_php: true
                php_cgi: "php-cgi"
                served_by: 'Node Simple Router'
                software_name: 'node-simple-router'
                admin_user: 'admin'
                admin_pwd: 'admin'
                use_nsr_session: true
                avail_nsr_session_handlers: ['dispatch.memory_store', 'dispatch.text_store']
                nsr_session_handler: 'dispatch.memory_store'
                </code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of them are self explanatory, but some deserve further comments,
                which will be added on doc completion.
            </p>
 
## Router API

Router object supports the following methods
#### <dfn>get</dfn>
_Usage:_

      router.get('/users/:id', function(request, response) {
        response.end("User: " + getUserById(request.params.id).fullName);});
          
#### <dfn>post</dfn>
_Usage:_

    router.post('/users', function(request, response) {
                        insertUser(request.post.user, function(new_user_id) {
                          request.post.user.id = new_user_id;
                          response.end(JSON.stringify(request.post.user);});
                        });

#### Handling file uploads
<span class="nsr">NSR</span> handles 'multipart/form-data' out of the box.
When <span class="nsr">NSR</span> detects a post having enctype="multipart/form-data" it
adds to the _request_ object the properties: <em>fileName, fileLen, fileData and
fileType</em>, which client code (your server) can handle as shown in the following usage example.

_Usage:_

        router.post("/handle_upload", function(request, response) {
        var encoding, fullname;
        response.writeHead(200, {'Content-type': 'text/html'});
        if (request.fileName) {
           response.write("&lt;h2&gt;Uploaded File Data&lt;/h2&g");
           response.write("File name = " + request.fileName + "&lt;br/&gt;");
           response.write("File length = " + request.fileLen + " bytes&lt;br/&gt;");
           response.write("File type = " + request.fileType + "&lt;br/&gt;");
           fullname = "" + __dirname + "/public/uploads/" + request.fileName;
           if (request.fileType.indexOf('text') &gt;= 0) {
              encoding = 'utf8';
           }
           else {
             encoding = 'binary';
           }
           return fs.writeFile(fullname, request.fileData, {encoding: encoding}, function(err) {
             if (err) {
               response.write("&lt;p style='color: red;'&gt;Something went wrong, uploaded file could not be saved.&lt;/p&gt;");
             }
             else {
               response.write('&lt;div style="text-align:center; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;"&gt;');
               if (request.fileType.indexOf('image') &gt;= 0) {
                 response.write("&lt;img src='/uploads/" + request.fileName + "' /&gt;");
               }
               else {
                 response.write("&lt;pre&gt;" + request.fileData + "&lt;/pre&gt;");
               }
               response.write("&lt;/div&gt;");
             }
             response.write("&lt;hr/&gt;");
             return response.end("&lt;div style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;button onclick=\"history.back();\"&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
           });
         }
         else {
           response.write("&lt;p style='color: red;'&gt;Something went wrong, looks like nothing was uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;");
           return response.end("&lt;div style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;button onclick=\"history.back();\"&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
         }
      });
      
#### <dfn>put</dfn>
_Usage:_

    router.put('/users', function(request, response) {
        updateUser(request.post.user, function(updated_user_id) {
        response.end(updated_user_id);})
    });                use_nsr_session: true<br/>
                avail_nsr_session_handlers: ['dispatch.memory_store', 'dispatch.text_store']<br/>
                nsr_session_handler: 'dispatch.memory_store'<br/>


#### <dfn>patch</dfn>
A variant for PUT

_Usage:_

    router.patch('/users', function(request, response) {
        updateUser(request.post.user, function(updated_user_id) {
        response.end(updated_user_id);});
    });

#### <dfn>delete</dfn>

_Usage:_

    router.delete('/users', function(request, response) {
        deleteUser(request.post.user_id, function(user_id) {
        response.end(user_id);});
    });

#### <dfn>any</dfn>
To be used when the request method is not known in advance. Sort of "catch all"

_Usage:_

    // Observe usage of 'request.body' as the union of 'request.get' and 'request.post'
    router.any('/users', function(request, response) {
        response.end("User: " + getUserById(request.body.user_id).fullName);}); 


### <dfn>Complementary methods</dfn>
 
Up to here, all the enumerated methods are directly related to <span class="nsr">NSR</span> primary activity: routing.

They are what you will use 90% of the time.

What follows are method loosely related to routing activity, but are the ones that give <span class="nsr">NSR</span> some of its distinctiveness.

#### <dfn>proxy_pass</dfn>

To deliver to the client the contents of an url from another server

_Usage:_

    router.get('/whatismyip', function(request, response) {
        router.proxy_pass('http://testing.savos.ods.org/wimi', response);});

#### <dfn><abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">cgi</abbr></dfn>

To pass the client the results of an external CGI program.

This one deserves an additional comment on its usefulness. While some - many perhaps - would argue that CGI doesn't make any sense from a Node.js development perspective, I still it's a worthy inclusion for a couple of reasons
 - First of all, you may have a legacy CGI module that you want/need to use in your brand new Node.js server - would you rewrite, for instance, Crafty, the chess engine, in Node?
 - Writing programs that can talk to each other through standard means (stdin, stdout) has passed the test of time, and I think it has it niche even in the web server world.
 - If performance is a concern - and it should be - the present considerations still stand for the next item: SCGI, which NSR also supports. But there would not have been SCGI without CGI
 - Last but not least, CGI support makes the same sense in the context of a Node.js web server thant it does in Nginx, Apache, etc.. I'm not aware of anybody suggestiong CGI support should be dropped from any of them.

_Usage:_

<samp>
    By default, any static resource having a path that includes the router option 'cgi-dir'
    (which defaults to "cgi-bin") will be treated by <span class="nsr">NSR</span>
    as a cgi program, provided the router option 'serve_cgi' is true.
    For example, the uri: `/cgi-bin/hello.py` will be handled as a CGI program.
    On the other hand, you can invoke directly the cgi method of the router, like so:
    `router.cgi('/hidden-cgi-dir/mycgi.rb', request, response);`
    Nevertheless, such way of using it is discouraged as it does not follow CGI standard
    guidelines.
</samp>

#### <dfn>scgi_pass</dfn>
                            

To pass the client the results of an external program running under the [SCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCGI) protocol.

Same considerations as those pertaining to CGI, with the added benefit of not having to spawn a new process each time.

Why SCGI and not <dfn title="Fast CGI">FCGI</dfn>? Well, SCGI protocol was far easier to implement, and I really couldn't find significant performance differences between the two. FCGI may be implenented in future versions.

_Usage:_

    //Example SCGI invocation. Output will be provided by a SCGI process listening on tcp port 26000.
    router.post("/scgi", function(request, response) {
      router.scgi_pass(26000, request, response);
    });

The first parameter for scgi_pass is the port number (for tcp sockets)
or the socket name (for unix sockets) at which the SCGI process is listening.

#### <dfn>render_template</dfn>
                            

To provide rudimentary template handling without compromising the goal of keeping <span class="nsr">NSR</span> lean and simple.

Even though templating is not directly related to routing, having a micro-templating utility was considered handy.

It is basically a naive implementation of [mustache.js](http://mustache.github.io/), which tries to follow the [spec](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), but at its current stage lacks partials and lambdas. Template handling as you would with any mustache template, as shown in the following example.

_Usage:_

    router.get("/greet_user/:user_id", function(request, response) {
      get_user_by_id(request.params.user_id, function (user) {
        template_str = "&lt;h2&gt;Hello, {{ name }}!&lt;h2&gt;";
        compiled_str = router.render_template(template_str, user); // returns "&lt;h2&gt;Hello, Joe Router!&lt;h2&gt;"
        response.end(compiled_str);
      }
    });

New in version 0.8.8: `render_template_file(fileName, context, callback, keep_tokens)` was added
The method signature is almost the same than for **render_template** with 2 differences worth noting

* The first parameter is a string containing the file name, not the template string itself.

* There is a new parameter, previous to last one: a callback function with the following signature:
`cb(exists, rendered_text);`. The reason for this is that obviously file retrieval is an async IO  operation and as such it needs a callback, which **render_template** doesn't need as there is no IO involved.
                                
Obviously it would have been better to keep only one method (**render_template**), letting it guess if the first parameter is  a file name or a template string, but doing it that way would introduce a backward incompatibility since **render_template** returns a string, while becoming async would make it need a callback. So... too late to regret. It's not big deal, anyway..


#### <dfn>Session handling</dfn>


This section deals with session handling utilities built in with NSR.

<p>
    <span class="nsr">NSR</span> augments the request object with a <em>nsr_session</em> object
    unless the option <em>use_nsr_session</em> is set to a falsy value (defaults to true).<br/>
    <strong><em>nsr_session</em></strong> is a javascript object that holds the session keys and values
    defined by the application. Incidentally, the reason <span class="nsr">NSR</span> uses
    <em>request.nsr_session</em> and not <em>request.session</em> is to avoid name collision in case
    that a separate session handling mechanism is used.
</p>

<p>
    Options related to session handling:
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
       <li><strong>use_nsr_session</strong> Set <em>nsr_session</em> on or off</li>
       <li><strong>avail_nsr_session_handlers</strong> Low level functions that perform the real action. See below for details</li>
       <li><strong>nsr_session_handler</strong> The one handler currently selected</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Methods related to session handling:
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><code>addSessionHandler(function, function_name)</code> Add your own function to the list of session handlers</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><code>setSessionHandler(func_name_or_ordinal)</code> Tell <span class="nsr">NSR</span> which of the available handlers to use (defaults to 0, 'memory_store').</li>
        <li><code>getSession(request, callback)</code> Get the current <em>request.nsr_session</em>.</li>
        <li><code>setSession(request, session_object, callback)</code> Set the current <em>request.nsr_session</em> with the provided session_object.</li>
        <li><code>updateSession(request, session_object, callback)</code> Update the current <em>request.nsr_session</em> with the provided session_object, keeping not included keys and adding-updating keys present in session_object.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-top: 1em;">
        The three latter methods are convenience wrappers to access the low level method that handles <em>nsr_session</em>
        which is responsible for the real implementation of the session mechanism.<br/>
        The 3 are asynchronous, having the <em>nsr_session</em> returned as the only argument to the callback function.<br/>
        Two low level handlers are provided built in: <em>memory_store</em> (default) and <em>text_store</em> (serializes each session to a file named by the session ID)<br/>
        If you don't need/want to construct your own implementation, you don't need to know a thing
        about it, but if you want to roll your own (for instance, if you want to save sessions to a database or a remote server)
        here are a couple of things that you should keey in mind:
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 1em;">
      <span style="1em; padding-left: 3em;">Function signature: <code>var db_store = function(request, opcode, sess_obj, callback);</code></span><br/>
      <span style="1em; padding-left: 3em;">Having a look at the source code used in <em>memory_store</em> and <em>text_store</em> should provide a fairly good idea of how things should work</span><br/>
      <span style="1em; padding-left: 3em;">In order to put your brand new session handler to work, you have to</span><br/>
      <span style="1em; padding-left: 4em;">1) Register it with <span class="nsr">NSR</span> by means of <em>addSessionHandler</em></span><br/>
      <span style="1em; padding-left: 4em;">2) Put it to use with <em>setSessionHandler</em></span><br/>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    You can see the session machinery in action in the <a href="http://node-simple-router.herokuapp.com/session">Session Handling</a> section of the demo site.<br/>
    By all means, review the code that makes it work in <em>test/server.js</em> or <em>test/server.coffee</em> if you are so inclined.

            There are a bunch of utilities that can make your job easier, such as mk-server, the standalone tool

### Real time

Beginning with v0.9.0 NSR becomes real time. Now not only http requests routing is enabled, 
but also the **ws** protocol (WebSockets) is implemented.

See all the juicy details at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sandy98/node-simple-router/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket section of
            NSR wiki</a> or see it in action <a href="http://node-simple-router.herokuapp.com/sillychat.html">at the demo site.</a>

### Added goodies

Really? Need more goodies?

Ok, here we go...
 -  **Default favicon** If your app doesn't have a favicon, <span class="nsr">NSR</span> provides one for you. I _REALLY_ suggest you provide yours...
 -  **Default '404 - Not found' page.** Once again, you're advised to provide your own.
 -  **Default '500 - Server Error' page.** Same applies here.
