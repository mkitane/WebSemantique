        "text": "Microsoft Monday announced a three-year, multimillion dollar partnership with the Special Olympics to modernize the nonprofit\u2019s software and games management system, and elevate it to the cloud.\n\u201cOur company is about reinventing productivity, to allow people to achieve more,\u201d says Jeff Hansen, general manager of Microsoft Brand Studio. \u201cIf you think about the Special Olympics and their mission to celebrate the achievements of people with intellectual disabilities, you understand that we couldn\u2019t be more aligned.\u201d\n\u201cThe Special Olympics\u2019 goal of creating a better world by fostering the acceptance and inclusion of all people is something we believe in here at Microsoft,\u201d adds Lisa Brummel Microsoft\u2019s executive vice president of Human Resources. \u201cI am thrilled about our partnership with the Special Olympics over the next few years and our opportunity to contribute both technology and financial support to help them run their organization.\u201d\nWhile the Special Olympics has a massive global footprint, they\u2019re a nonprofit that has had to run \u201clean and mean\u201d Hansen explains. \u201cThey realized they\u2019d hit a ceiling if they didn\u2019t modernize their technology. That\u2019s where Microsoft came in.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re so excited. This is going to change our world.\u201d says Special Olympics Chief Executive Officer Janet Froetscher. \u201cOur partnership with Microsoft is going to allow us to leap frog into the next universe and be able to execute on our mission in a much more powerful way.\u201d\nSpecial Olympics has nearly 4.5 million athletes in 170 countries around the world. Froetscher says the organization has been limited in its ability to do things like schedule them to compete, track performance information and capture health data. \u201cThe more we can make that technology driven, the more power our movement has,\u201d she explains.\nThe Azure-based games management system will enable instant access to real-time updates and athlete information. Microsoft will also provide 800 Surface tablets and 1,200 Lumia phones, which will be used to track all events at the 2015 World Games in Los Angeles, while connecting volunteers across multiple venues.\nMicrosoft will sponsor the summer 2015 Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles and the winter 2017 World Games in Austria. The company has also committed to raising additional funds for the nonprofit, pledging $1 million over the life of the partnership in the spirit of Microsoft\u2019s company-wide Giving Campaign.\n\u201cWe are excited and eager to raise money for their organization and their cause,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cAt the heart of it, it\u2019s about more than the games; it\u2019s about raising awareness for the acceptance and inclusion of individuals with intellectual disabilities.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s multidimensional and a phenomenal financial commitment, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d adds Froetscher. \u201cIt\u2019s changing people\u2019s hearts and minds and Microsoft and its employees have the ability to take us there, to deliver on our mission in a virtual way.\u201d\nTo announce the partnership, Microsoft held a soccer match on its Redmond campus between mixed teams including Special Olympics Play Unified athletes from Roosevelt High School and Microsoft employees, with Seattle Sounders FC legends Roger Levesque, Kasey Keller, Taylor Graham and Michael Morris appearing as coaches. Also on hand was Sound Wave, the Sounders marching band, as well as executives from both Microsoft and the Special Olympics.\nTed Youmans, a senior software engineer lead and 15-year Microsoft employee, attended with his son, Ty, 11, who has cerebral palsy. Of the partnership, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for Microsoft to showcase some of its technology and bring the full end-to-end solution to bear for the Special Olympics, an organization that\u2019s near and dear to my heart.\u201d\nTy, who has an interest in sports, but has never played soccer, was excited to have the opportunity to warm up with the players. \u201cI want to be part of a team,\u201d he says, \u201cto pass the ball to the other players, to make friends.\u201d\n\u201cWe hope this becomes an opportunity for him to see, by meeting some of the Special Olympics Athletes, what\u2019s possible with a lot of dedication and hard work,\u201d adds Youmans.\nSam Bartholomew, 23, a member of last year\u2019s gold-medal-winning soccer team in the Special Olympics masters division, also participated in Monday\u2019s game.\n\u201cI want to show everyone what disabled people can do,\u201d Bartholomew says. \u201cI want to show other people that we have fun whether we win or lose.\u201d\nBartholomew works in Compass Dining Services as part of Microsoft\u2019s Real Estate and Facilities Supported Employment Program, which provides job opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities. Dave Bryant is the supported employment program manager for CBRE, Microsoft\u2019s facilities partner.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really neat, about this soccer match, and the fact that it\u2019s celebrating the partnership between Microsoft and Special Olympics, is that demonstrates a culture of acceptance,\u201d Bryant says. \u201cBeing on a team is a great metaphor for a larger team effort and a great example of inclusion where everyone has a chance to participate.\u201d\n"
