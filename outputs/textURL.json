I was totally hyped to be invited back (10years later!!!) to produce a piece of work for the new ART ZONE area.\nI painted 2 new GIF-ITI piece for the festival.\nThe first is perhaps my most technical challenging to date\u2026..\nHere are all 8 individual paintings, i wont be posting the finished GIF yet as i have exciting news about a new APP launching soon. And you will be able to see the piece come to life with the APP! Whoop whoop!\nThe second GIF-ITI piece is a colaberation with artist MASER\nHere is an interview i did while at Roskilde with danish site THE MEAT\nThanks to Lars and everybody in ArtZone and Graff Camp for an awesome time! #RFgraff #OrangeFeeling\nA couple of months back i was out in Shanghai to oversee the completion of my art/interior collaboration with Architect INDJ.\nG\u4e5d \u4e0a\u6d77 (G9 Shanghai) is a restaurant set within a dramatic triple height space that is part of main land China\u2019s first luxury department store; Lane Crawford. The central focal point of the restaurant is this huge interactive Lighting installation that cascades through the space and down my \u2018Grafitti Fetish\u2019 light wall:\n14976 LED\u2019s\n 9200m of cable\n 956 pendant light installation\n 99 seats\n 67sqm artwork\n 1 Kinect camera\nMake this a truly unique and luxurious art piece that can be played with and controlled from the VIP seating mezzanine.\n Watch this clip>>>\nI feel extremely excited to show this piece as it was a great pleasure to work with INDJ and the restaurant owner on creating this piece.\nAbout the space:\nG\u4e5d is a culmination of ideas that have influenced atelier I-N-D-J from the studios inception.  Technology Industry Luxury and Excess collide; manifest in concrete, raw steel, black marble, shimmering gold, bright light and high art.  G\u4e5d is a brash celebration for the rise of the Chinese economic super power, more so glittered with gold befitting of the Paris of the east \u2013 \u4e0a\u6d77 \nThe notion of luxury and excess reaches it\u2019s pinnacle with a major site specific super scaled artwork by British artist INSA.  A user activated Lighting installation cascades through the space terminating in INSA\u2019s trademark \u2018Grafitti Fetish\u2019 \u2013 an exploration of the iconography of modern aspirations: for the artist, the graffiti fetish concisely embodies the central concern of his output.  The graffiti fetish pattern derives from two archetypal icons associated with contemporary femininity: high heels and curves \u2013 objects that have also become aspirational commodities. Within the undulating contours of this apparently abstract design, a two-fold vision of these icons is revealed: they simultaneously celebrate and question our consumerist ideology. \nBalanced upon a lateral beam A VIP platform sits high above the banquette table, this elevated position serves as symbolic elevation of status, an exclusive position of grandeur from which to survey the space, here users are invited to engage in the light installation and art piece \u2013 a 3d depth sensing camera empowers the user with the ability to control the speed brightness and pattern of the light with simple hand gestures, In this way the light installation and art work in synchronisation controlled by a singular user. \nThe light installation and art work collaboration between indj and Insa marks an evolution of INSA\u2019s pioneering work with the GIF medium; whereby multiple frames are painstakingly painted photographed and animated digitally.  G9 is a reversal of this process whereby the digital is manifest physically in the 67sqm art work.\nI recently returned from Taiwan where i collaborated with friend and awesome artist MADSTEEZ for POW WOW TAIWAN \n I kind of stupidly forced us into the challenge of creating my biggest and in turn the worlds biggest GIF-ITI piece yet!\nSo 5 days painting dawn until dusk in and out of monsoon rain showers and on the scariest swing stages ever, we painted this 8 story (120 foot) high building 4 times\u2026\u2026\nINSA x MADSTEEZ- The Worlds Largest GIF\nHere is a cool short film Mr Steez put together where you see a timelapse of us painting this beast, the view from the main subway line and the most beautiful shot from a helicopter of the wall in progress- WATCH IT:\nA physically and mentally challenging week, but snake blood shots and good old fashioned ego and beer drove us through it.\nThanks to Larry and Miya, Jasper and Kamea, Cherry, Elaine and Vicky and all of the people involved in POW WOW TAIWAN who help make this possible xxx\nBonaroo Festival is America\u2019s largest music festival.\nLocated in small town Manchester,Tennessee.\nOne of the centre points of the festival is the Mushroom shaped water fountain, every year the festival invite an artist to paint it.
