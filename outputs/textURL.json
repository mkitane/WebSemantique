Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.\nIn 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\nObama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.\nObama was born on August 4, 1961,[1] at Kapi\u02bbolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital (now Kapi\u02bbolani Medical Center for Women and Children) in Honolulu, Hawaii,[2]  [3]  [4] and would become the first President to have been born in Hawaii.[5] His mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was of mostly English ancestry.[6] His father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a Luo from Nyang\u2019oma Kogelo, Kenya. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian class at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.[7]  [8] The couple married in Wailuku on Maui on February 2, 1961,[9]  [10] and separated when, in late August 1961, Obama's mother moved with their newborn son to attend the University of Washington in Seattle for one year. In the meantime, Obama, Sr. completed his undergraduate economics degree in Hawaii in June 1962, then left to attend graduate school at Harvard University on a scholarship. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[11] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964 where he remarried; he visited Barack in Hawaii only once, in 1971.[12] He died in an automobile accident in 1982 when his son was 21 years old.[13]\nIn 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian East\u2013West Center graduate student in geography at the University of Hawaii, and the couple were married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[14] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966, followed sixteen months later by his wife and stepson in 1967, with the family initially living in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta, then from 1970 in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[15] From ages six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School for two years and Besuki Public School for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[16]\nObama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham, and with the aid of a scholarship attended Punahou School, a private college preparatory school, from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.[17] Obama lived with his mother and sister in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[18] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[19] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following treatment for ovarian cancer and uterine cancer.[20]\nOf his early childhood, Obama recalled, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me\u2014that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk\u2014barely registered in my mind.\"[8] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[21] Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered\u2014to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect\u2014became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[22] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind\".[23] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[24]  [25]\nAfter high school, Obama moved to Los Angeles in 1979 to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[26] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[26] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations [27] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[28] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1983 and worked for a year at the Business International Corporation,[29] then at the New York Public Interest Research Group.[30]  [31] In 1985, Obama was among the leaders of May Day efforts to bring attention to the New York City Subway system, which was in a bad condition at the time. Obama traveled to several subway stations to get people to sign letters addressed to local officials and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and was photographed at the City College subway station holding a sign protesting the system's condition.[32]\nTwo years after graduating, Obama was hired in Chicago as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[31]  [33] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[34] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[35] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[36]  [37] He returned to Kenya in 1992 with his fianc\u00e9e Michelle and his half-sister Auma.[36]  [38] He returned to Kenya in August 2006 for a visit to his father's birthplace, a village near Kisumu in rural western Kenya.[39]\nObama entered Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988. He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[40] president of the journal in his second year,[34]  [41] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[42] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[43] After graduating with a J.D. magna cum laude [44] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[40] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[34]  [41] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[45] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[45]\nIn 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[45]  [46] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[47]\nFrom April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.[48]\nHe joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. His law license became inactive in 2007.[49]  [50]\nFrom 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and of the Joyce Foundation.[31] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[31]\nObama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding State Senator Alice Palmer as Senator from Illinois's 13th District, which at that time spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park\u00a0\u2013 Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[51] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[52] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[53] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[54]\nHe was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002.[55] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[56]\nIn January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[57] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[53]  [58] During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[59] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[60]\nIn May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race; he created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[61]\nObama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[62] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[63] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[64] and spoke out against the war.[65] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd that \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.[66]\nDecisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates.[67] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide\u2014which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[68] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[69] seen by 9.1\u00a0million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[70]\nObama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[71] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[72] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70\u00a0percent of the vote.[73]\nObama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[74] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[75]  CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes in 2005\u20132007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[76]\nObama cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[77] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar\u2013Obama, which expanded the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[78] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[79] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama\u2014along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain\u2014introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[80]\nObama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.[81] Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.[82]\nIn December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[84] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[85] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,[86] and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.[87]\nLater in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[88] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[89] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[90] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[91]\nObama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.[92] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[93] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs.[94] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[95]\nOn February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[96]  [97] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.[96]  [98] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system,[99] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.[100]\nA large number of candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[101] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[102]\nOn August 23, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[103] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[104] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[105] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of over 75,000; the speech was viewed by over 38\u00a0million people worldwide.[106]  [107]\nDuring both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[108] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[109]\nJohn McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and the two engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[110] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[111] Obama won 52.9% of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.[112] He became the first African American to be elected president.[113] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.[114]\nOn April 4, 2011, Obama announced his re-election campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission.[115]  [116]  [117] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[118] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[119]\nAt the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, former President Bill Clinton formally nominated Obama and Joe Biden as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election, in which their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[120]\nOn November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be re-elected as president.[121]  [122]  [123] With 51.1% of the popular vote,[124] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win the majority of the popular vote.[125]  [126] President Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"[127]  [128]\nThe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[129] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[130] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[131]  [132]  [133] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[134] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[135] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[136]\nThe first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[137] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4\u00a0million uninsured children.[138] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy which had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.[139]\nObama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. Sonia Sotomayor, nominated by Obama on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter, was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[140] becoming the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice.[141]  Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three, for the first time in American history.[142]\nOn September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[143]  [144]\nOn October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expands the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[145]  [146]\nOn March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a reconciliation bill which ends the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increases the Pell Grant scholarship award, and makes changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[147]  [148]\nIn a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[149]\nOn December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, fulfilling a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[150]  [151] to end the Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.[152]\nPresident Obama's 2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised that the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and would be 80% reliant on \"clean\" electricity.[153]  [154]\nAs a candidate for the Illinois state senate Obama had said in 1996 that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage;[155] but by the time of his run for the U.S. senate in 2004, he said that while he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, for strategic reasons he opposed same-sex marriages.[156] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[157]  [158]\nDuring his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[128] Obama called for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law\u00a0\u2014 for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was a historic moment, being the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[159]  [160] In 2013 the Obama administration filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[161] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[162]\nOn November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[163]  [164]\nOn March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which forms part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[165] The Council is currently chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.[166] Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through an official United States government memorandum on January 22, 2014 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[166]  [167]  [168] The current co-chairs of the Task Force are Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.[167] The Task Force has been a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that, the 1994 Violence Against Women Act that was first-drafted by Biden.[169]\nOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787\u00a0billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[170] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[171]\nIn March, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two\u00a0trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[172] Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry [173] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat [174] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[175] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[176] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers\", that temporarily boosted the economy.[177]  [178]  [179]\nSpending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5\u00a0trillion, but only $3\u00a0trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[180] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5\u00a0trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4\u00a0trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[181]  [182] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will slightly shrink to $1.34\u00a0trillion, while the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53\u00a0trillion or 90% of GDP.[183] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2\u00a0trillion took effect in February 2014.[184] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5\u00a0trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2\u00a0trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[185] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[186]\nAs it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[189] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[190] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[191] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[192] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[193] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[194] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[194] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain\".[195] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[196]\nThe Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[197]  [198] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1\u20132.1\u00a0million,[198]  [199]  [200]  [201] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"[197] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[202]\nWithin a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[203] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[204]\nIn December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[205]\nOn April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. The well's operator, BP, initiated a containment and cleanup plan, and began drilling two relief wells intended to stop the flow. Obama visited the Gulf on May 2 among visits by members of his cabinet, and again on May 28 and June 4. On May 22, he announced a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. On May 27, he announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[206] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[207]\nIn July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and stated he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions\".[208]  [209] Obama's advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[210]\nObama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[211] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900\u00a0billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[212]  [213]\nOn July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[211] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[214] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[215]\nOn November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[216]  [217] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill\u2014without a public option\u2014on a party-line vote of 60\u201339.[218] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[219] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[220]\nThe ACA includes health-related provisions to take effect over four years, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[221] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 9.5% of income,[222]  [223] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[222]  [224]\nThe costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[225] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[226] In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[227]\nThe law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5\u20134 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the Commerce Clause does not allow the government to require people to buy health insurance, but the mandate was constitutional under the US Congress's taxing authority.[228] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives.\nPrior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic energy policy which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[229] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of nation's available energy resources.[230]  [231]\nOn January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, President Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[232] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[233]\nObama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[234] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking\".[235] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[236]\nIn February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[237] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, Al Arabiya.[238]\nOn March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[239]  [240] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[241] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[242]\nOn June 26, 2009, in response to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election, Obama said: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"[243] On July 7, while in Moscow, he responded to a Vice President Biden comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"[244]\nOn September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[245]\nIn March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[246]  [247] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.[248] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[249]\nIn December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[250] He criticized Russia's law discriminating against gays in August 2013,[251] stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.[252]\nOn February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"[253] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[254]  [255] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[256] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays\".[257]\nIn June 2014, amid territorial gains made by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant following the U.S. withdrawal in 2011, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.[258]\nEarly in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[259] He announced an increase to U.S. troop levels of 17,000 in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan\", an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires\".[260] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[261] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[262] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[263] In February 2013 Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 US troops by February 2014.[264]\nIn June 2012, Obama said that the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"[265] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[266] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[267]\nIn 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[268] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[269]\nIn 2013, one journalist reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"[270]\nIn March 2011, as forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[271] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[272] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi\u2014who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi[273]\u2014announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[274] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[275] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[276]  [277]  [278] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[279] Some Representatives[280] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[281]  [282]\nStarting with information received in July 2010, intelligence developed by the CIA over the next several months determined what they believed to be the location of Osama bin Laden in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles from Islamabad.[283] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[283] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[283] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, resulting in the death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[284]  [285] DNA testing identified bin Laden's body,[286] which was buried at sea several hours later.[287] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[284]  [288]  Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush,[289] and from many countries around the world.[290]\nObama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[291] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"[292] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"[293]\nObama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[294] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama has delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[295]\nAccording to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating[297] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,[298] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[299] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden, which lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were prior to the operation.[300]  [301]  [302] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his re-election in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.[303] Polls show strong support for Obama in other countries,[304] and before being elected President he met with prominent foreign figures including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair,[305] Italy's Democratic Party leader and Mayor of Rome Walter Veltroni,[306] and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[307]\nIn a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[308] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[309]  [310]\nObama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.[311] His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \"Yes We Can\", which was viewed 10\u00a0million times on YouTube in its first month[312] and received a Daytime Emmy Award.[313] In December 2008 and in 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year.[314] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments\".[315] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, London. This was only the 5th occurrence since the start of the 20th century, of a head of state being extended this invitation, following Charles de Gaulle in 1960, Nelson Mandela in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.[316]  [317]\nOn October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\".[318] Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"[319] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[320]  [321]  [322]  [323]  [324]  [325]  [326] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by The New York Times.[327] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[328]\nIn a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations\", he said. \"I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.\"[329] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family\u00a0\u2013 six of them living.[330] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[331] until her death on November 2, 2008,[332] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[333] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.[334]\nBesides his native English, Obama speaks some basic Indonesian, having learned the language during his four childhood years in Jakarta.[335]  [336] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team;[337] he is left-handed.[338]\nObama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[339] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the all star game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[340] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President.[341] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[342]\nIn June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[343] Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.[344] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[345] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,[346] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), on June 10, 2001.[347] The Obama daughters attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the private Sidwell Friends School.[348] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs, the first, a male named Bo, a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[349] In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[350]\nApplying the proceeds of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6\u00a0million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[351] The purchase of an adjacent lot\u2014and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko\u2014attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[352]\nIn December 2007, Money estimated the Obama family's net worth at $1.3\u00a0million.[353] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5\u00a0million\u2014up from about $4.2\u00a0million in 2007 and $1.6\u00a0million in 2005\u2014mostly from sales of his books.[354]  [355] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[356]  [357] As per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[358]\nObama tried to quit smoking several times, sometimes using nicotine replacement therapy, and, in early 2010, Michelle Obama said that he had successfully quit smoking.[359]  [360]\nObama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[361] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as \"non-practicing Methodists and Baptists\"), as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"[362]\nIn January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"[363] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't\u2014frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church.

Jeremiah Wright in October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[366] He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign after some of Wright's statements were criticized.[367] After a prolonged effort to find a church to attend regularly in Washington, Obama announced in June 2009 that his primary place of worship would be the Evergreen Chapel at Camp David.[368]\nIt was announced in April 2014 that the Barack Obama College Preparatory High School will open in Chicago, Illinois in 2017.[369]\nThe deadline for bids for the Obama library was set for June 16, 2014, with several major bids originating in the city of Chicago.[370] Among the leading bids proposed for the competition were proposals from the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Columbia University in New York and the University of Hawaii.[371]\n^ \"President Barack Obama\".

Fifty-two percent (52%) disapprove (see trends). \n The latest figures include 21% who Strongly Approve of the way Obama is performing as president and 40% who Strongly Disapprove.

Here are our final numbers for the Louisiana Senate race. \n The federal government released an upbeat jobs report on Friday. The Rasmussen Employment Index which measures worker confidence jumped to a six-year high in November. \n One-out-of-two working Americans still expect a pay raise in the coming year, but those who classify themselves as the working poor are much less optimistic. \n Fewer Americans who are job hunting are confident that their next job will be better than the one they've got now. \n (More below) \n Following alleged cyberattacks by North Korea and Iran, voters remain highly concerned about such attacks and feel more strongly than ever that they should be considered acts of war. \n Still, holiday shoppers are flocking to online sales.  \n Forty-four percent (44%) of voters think the United States needs stricter gun control, but 49% disagree.\u00a0   \n (More below) \n Some readers wonder\u00a0how we come up with our job approval ratings for the president\u00a0since they often don\u2019t show as dramatic a change as some other pollsters do. It depends on how you ask the question and whom you ask.\u00a0 \n To get a sense of longer-term job approval trends for the president, Rasmussen Reports compiles our tracking data on a full\u00a0month-by-month basis. \n Rasmussen Reports has been a pioneer in the use of automated telephone polling techniques, but many other firms still utilize their own operator-assisted technology (see methodology). \n Daily tracking results are collected via telephone surveys of 500 likely voters per night and reported on a three-day rolling average basis. To reach those who have abandoned traditional landline telephones, Rasmussen Reports uses an online survey tool to interview randomly selected participants from a demographically diverse panel.\u00a0The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 1,500 Likely Voters is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence.

        "text": "In July, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling that threatened the future of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. By a vote of two to one, the court held, in Halbig v. Burwell, that the insurance subsidies that allow millions of Americans to buy health insurance were contrary to the text of the law and thus were illegal. If such a decision had been made earlier in Obama\u2019s tenure, lawyers for his Administration would have been left with a single, risky option: an appeal to the politically polarized, and usually conservative, Supreme Court.\nThis year, the lawyers had another choice. When President Obama took office, the full D.C. Circuit had six judges appointed by Republican Presidents, three named by Democrats, and two vacancies. By the time of the Halbig decision, Obama had placed four judges on the D.C. court, which shifted its composition to seven Democratic appointees and four Republicans. In light of this realignment, the Obama Administration asked the full D.C. Circuit to vacate the panel\u2019s decision and rehear the Halbig case en banc\u2014that is, with all the court\u2019s active judges participating. The full court promptly agreed with the request, and the decision that would have crippled Obamacare is no longer on the books. Oral argument before the full court is now set for December.\nThe transformation of the D.C. Circuit has been replicated in federal courts around the country. Obama has had two hundred and eighty judges confirmed, which represents about a third of the federal judiciary. Two of his choices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were nominated to the Supreme Court; fifty-three were named to the circuit courts of appeals, two hundred and twenty-three to the district courts, and two to the Court of International Trade. When Obama took office, Republican appointees controlled ten of the thirteen circuit courts of appeals; Democratic appointees now constitute a majority in nine circuits. Because federal judges have life tenure, nearly all of Obama\u2019s judges will continue serving well after he leaves office.\nObama\u2019s judicial nominees look different from their predecessors. In an interview in the Oval Office, the President told me, \u201cI think there are some particular groups that historically have been underrepresented\u2014like Latinos and Asian-Americans\u2014that represent a larger and larger portion of the population. And so for them to be able to see folks in robes that look like them is going to be important. When I came into office, I think there was one openly gay judge who had been appointed. We\u2019ve appointed ten.\u201d\nThe statistics affirm Obama\u2019s boast. Sheldon Goldman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a scholar of judicial appointments, said, \u201cThe majority of Obama\u2019s appointments are women and nonwhite males.\u201d Forty-two per cent of his judgeships have gone to women. Twenty-two per cent of George W. Bush\u2019s judges and twenty-nine per cent of Bill Clinton\u2019s were women. Thirty-six per cent of President Obama\u2019s judges have been minorities, compared with eighteen per cent for Bush and twenty-four per cent for Clinton. Obama said that the new makeup of the federal bench \u201cspeaks to the larger shifts in our society, where what\u2019s always been this great American strength\u2014this stew that we are\u2014is part and parcel of every institution, both in the public sector as well as in the private sector.\u201d\nBeyond diversity, the story of Obama\u2019s influence on the courts is more complex. Indeed, it could serve as a metaphor for his Presidency: symbolically rich but substantively hazy. Obama took office after years of intense conservative focus on the courts. President George W. Bush spoke often of the need for judges who \u201cwill strictly apply the Constitution and laws, not legislate from the bench.\u201d The conservative agenda included limiting abortion rights, ending racial preferences, and lowering barriers between church and state. Obama has shrunk from an ideological battle with conservatives on these constitutional issues. Claims for his judges are grounded in their personal integrity and professional competence. Notwithstanding their qualifications, many of his appointees have drawn fierce opposition from Senate Republicans. In those battles, too, where his judicial legacy has been at stake, the President has chosen to remain largely above the fray.\nTo the extent that there is an Obama legal legacy, it centers on gay rights and voting rights, subjects that the President addresses more with caution than with passion. Obama served as president of the Harvard Law Review (Class of 1991), and taught at the University of Chicago law school for more than a decade. He was never exactly a legal academic; he didn\u2019t write law-review articles or seek a tenure-track job. He taught classes once a week while practicing law and, later, while serving in the Illinois state senate, in Springfield. When it comes to the law, Obama may never have been a full professor, but he remains fully professorial.\nI asked him to name the best Supreme Court decision of his tenure. When the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, in 2012? When it struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a year later? Neither, it turned out.\n\u201cIn some ways, the decision that was just handed down to not do anything about what states are doing on same-sex marriage may end up being as consequential\u2014from my perspective, a positive sense\u2014as anything that\u2019s been done,\u201d the President said. \u201cBecause I think it really signals that although the Court was not quite ready\u2014it didn\u2019t have sufficient votes to follow Loving v. Virginia and go ahead and indicate an equal-protection right across the board\u2014it was a consequential and powerful signal of the changes that have taken place in society and that the law is having to catch up.\u201d In the Loving decision, from 1967, the Court held that states could no longer ban racial intermarriage.\nIn other words, Obama\u2019s favorite decision was one in which the Court allowed the political process to go forward, one state at a time. Not long ago, the President described his foreign-policy doctrine as one that \u201cavoids errors. You hit singles, you hit doubles.\u201d On same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court had hit a single, or maybe a double, and that was fine with him.\nObama opposed marriage equality until May of 2012. He told me that he now believes the Constitution requires all states to allow same-sex marriage, an argument that his Administration has not yet made before the Supreme Court. \u201cUltimately, I think the Equal Protection Clause does guarantee same-sex marriage in all fifty states,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, as you know, courts have always been strategic. There have been times where the stars were aligned and the Court, like a thunderbolt, issues a ruling like Brown v. Board of Education, but that\u2019s pretty rare. And, given the direction of society, for the Court to have allowed the process to play out the way it has may make the shift less controversial and more lasting.\u201d\n\u201cThe bulk of my nominees, twenty years ago or even ten years ago, would have been considered very much centrists, well within the mainstream of American jurisprudence, not particularly fire-breathing or ideologically driven,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo the fact that now Democratic appointees and Republican appointees tend to vote differently on issues really has more to do with the shift in the Republican Party and in the nature of Republican-appointed jurists.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Democrats haven\u2019t moved from where they were.\u201d\nThis is how Obama has attempted to define his Presidency\u2014as an exemplar of common sense set against the extremism of the contemporary Republican Party. He has had the same mixed success in making this argument for his judges as he has had on most other issues during the past six years.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, in a recent interview published in Elle, said that she would not yet step down from the Court. \u201cIf I resign anytime this year,\u201d she argued, Obama \u201ccould not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the Court.\u201d\nI asked Obama if Ginsburg was right about his political weakness. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got a pretty good track record,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of Supreme Court Justices confirmed who I think are doing outstanding work. My sense is that the Senate necessarily has to treat the Supreme Court nomination process differently than the circuit- or district-court nomination process\u2014higher profile, people are paying attention.\u201d He found that most people pay little attention to lower-court appointments, but when it comes to the Supreme Court \u201cthey have the sense \u2018All right, this is big,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and the media cover the story intensely, \u201cwhich means that some of the shenanigans that were taking place in terms of blocking appointments, stalling appointments, I think are more difficult to pull off during a Supreme Court nomination process.\n\u201cHaving said that, Justice Ginsburg is doing a wonderful job. She is one of my favorite people. Life tenure means she gets to decide, not anybody else, when she chooses to go.\u201d Asked whether he had any advice about her retirement, Obama replied, with a big smile, \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d\nStill, what the President calls \u201cshenanigans\u201d have defined his effort to move his circuit-court and district-court nominations through the Senate. For a politician who is still fairly new on the political scene, Obama has had considerable experience with judicial nominations and confirmations\u2014a subject of great controversy in the past decade. As a senator and as President, Obama has recoiled from the particulars of these fights, leaving others to do the dirty work.\nCharles Grassley, the veteran Republican senator from Iowa, dates the conflict between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate over judges to 1987. \u201cIt all starts with Bork,\u201d Grassley told me. After contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearings chaired by Joseph Biden, Ronald Reagan\u2019s nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court was voted down, fifty-eight to forty-two. Four years later, Clarence Thomas\u2019s nomination produced an even more rancorous struggle. Ginsburg was confirmed easily, in 1993, as was Stephen Breyer, in 1994.\nThe tumultuous end to the 2000 election led to a renewed period of partisan struggle in the Senate over the confirmation of judges, which has never really ended. \u201cRight after Bush was elected, all the Senate Democrats went on a retreat, with these liberal law professors, and they came back and changed the ground rules on judicial nominations,\u201d Jeff Sessions, the Republican senator from Alabama, told me. \u201cThere is no question that the Democrats were always the aggressors on judicial nominations.\u201d In particular, Senate Democrats rallied against the nomination of Miguel Estrada, a widely admired Republican lawyer, to the D.C. Circuit. Repeated filibusters forced him to withdraw, in 2003. More than a decade later, his defeat still irks Senate Republicans. \u201cEstrada is the poster child for how the Democrats destroyed the process,\u201d Sessions told me.\nMost of George W. Bush\u2019s judicial nominations were easily confirmed, but, in 2005, many Democratic senators decided to make a stand. They objected to several of his circuit-court nominees, and refused to allow votes to take place. The D.C. Circuit\u2014often described as the second most important court in the nation\u2014was the focus of the dispute. Democrats fought the nominations of Janice Rogers Brown, a justice of the California Supreme Court, who had once called Social Security and other New Deal programs \u201cthe triumph of our own socialist revolution,\u201d and Brett Kavanaugh, a Bush White House aide who had made his name as a principal author of the Starr report.\nThere were only forty-five Democrats in the Senate, but that was enough to prevent the nominations from coming to the floor for a vote. Under the Senate rules, it took sixty votes to end a filibuster. In response to the Democratic tactics, Bill Frist, the Majority Leader at the time, threatened to invoke what became known as \u201cthe nuclear option,\u201d which would have changed the Senate rules to allow nominations to proceed with a simple majority.\nObama had just been elected to the Senate, and, as he later suggested in his book \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d he viewed the battle with disdain. \u201cI remember muffling a laugh the first time I heard the term \u2018nuclear option,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt seemed to perfectly capture the loss of perspective that had come to characterize judicial confirmations.\u201d In Obama\u2019s account, he supported the efforts of Democratic colleagues, but with reservations. \u201cI doubted that our use of the filibuster would dispel the image of Democrats always being on the defensive\u2014a perception that we used the courts and lawyers and procedural tricks to avoid having to win over popular opinion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI wondered if, in our reliance on the courts to vindicate not only our rights but also our values, progressives had lost too much faith in democracy.\u201d\nIn 2005, a bipartisan group of senators who became known as the Gang of 14 achieved a compromise of sorts. The Republicans agreed to maintain the rules, and the Democrats agreed not to filibuster judicial nominees unless there were \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d The agreement led to the confirmation of almost all of Bush\u2019s nominees, including Brown and Kavanaugh.\nThat, more or less, was how things stood when Obama became President. Sixty votes were still required to end debate on judicial nominees, but the minority party in the Senate\u2014now the Republicans\u2014was supposed to acquiesce to votes unless the judicial candidate presented \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d\nHarry Reid and Barack Obama belong to the same political party but to different worlds. At seventy-four, the Senate Majority Leader is a generation older than the President, and his rough-hewn upbringing, in Searchlight, Nevada, makes him more comfortable with close political combat than with polished phrasemaking. When Reid was a law student, at George Washington University, in the nineteen-sixties, he didn\u2019t spend his spare time on scholarly publications; he moonlighted as a Capitol police officer.\nWhen I visited Reid in his small, elegant office, just off the Senate floor, he spoke wistfully about the first two years of Obama\u2019s Presidency, when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and enjoyed a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. \u201cThis first Congress, we were very successful. We were successful during the regular Congress, we were really successful in the lame duck,\u201d he told me. But in 2010 the Democrats lost the House and several seats in the Senate, and, as a result, Reid told me, \u201cthe last two Congresses have been awful.\u201d\nWith the House in Republican hands, the chances of passing meaningful legislation diminished to nearly zero, and that, in a peculiar way, put more focus on the issue of judicial nominations. Reid could confirm judges without the assent of the House, so he tried to push through as many nominations as he could. In his view, Republicans have violated the pledge made in the Gang of 14 pact of 2005. Instead of filibustering only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d Republicans routinely insisted on sixty-vote majorities to end debate on lower-court judicial nominees. \u201cI regret having been one of the premier movers of that deal we made, stopping the nuclear option,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI wanted to make peace here, I wanted the place to work better. Once they got those people on there\u2014Janice Rogers Brown, a guy named Kavanaugh\u2014they were virtually bringing everything to a standstill.\u201d\nWho filibustered more\u2014the Democrats under Bush, or the Republicans under Obama\u2014is disputable. Republicans have used filibusters to stop outright only two of Obama\u2019s judicial nominations: Caitlin Halligan, a former aide to Andrew Cuomo, nominated to the D.C. Circuit; and Goodwin Liu, a Berkeley law professor, nominated to the Ninth Circuit. (Governor Jerry Brown later appointed Liu to the California Supreme Court.) But delays by Republican senators have slowed the confirmation process. \u201cIn the scheme of things, the long-term trend here, at least since the mid-eighties, is declining confirmation rates and rising length of time it takes to get nominees on the bench,\u201d Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, told me.\nThe Senate\u2019s inability to accomplish anything, including the confirmation of judges, began generating disquiet within Reid\u2019s Democratic caucus. Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, and Tom Udall, of New Mexico, began pressing him to invoke his own nuclear option: to change the Senate rules so that only fifty-one votes, not sixty, were necessary to bring judges up for a vote. This precipitated a generational struggle among Democrats. An older group of senators, including Reid, initially opposed such a major change in the Senate\u2019s rules.\nThe turning point came last November, when Reid brought to the Senate floor three Obama nominees to the D.C. Circuit: Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins. (A fourth Obama nominee, Sri Srinivasan, had been confirmed earlier in the year.) As the debate began, it became clear that few Republicans had any substantive objections to any of the nominees. Rather, they argued that the D.C. Circuit heard so few cases that there was no need to fill the vacant judgeships. \u201cThe D.C. Circuit is a thorn in my saddle,\u201d John Cornyn, of Texas, told me. He said that Democrats simply wanted to gain a majority for cases when the judges sat en banc.\nReid confronted a dilemma, much as Frist had done in 2005. Like all his Democratic colleagues, Reid scoffed at the Republicans\u2019 rationale for denying the votes. The Republicans had tried to fill those same seats on the D.C. Circuit when Bush was President. It hardly counts as court-packing to fill existing judicial vacancies. But Reid had only fifty-three votes. \u201cI\u2019m a traditionalist here,\u201d Reid told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stir up a lot of trouble.\u201d Then, last November, Reid said, his deputy leader, Richard Durbin, of Illinois, remarked that their Republican colleagues were mocking them. \u201cAnd I knew that was true,\u201d Reid went on. \u201cHe said, \u2018They\u2019re just saying to each other, \u201cHey, he wants to change the rules, let him do it.\u201d \u2019 Because they didn\u2019t think we had the votes.\u201d\nRepublican intransigence about the D.C. Circuit nominees finally brought around even the most senior Democrats to the idea of filibuster reform. \u201cI was probably the last person to agree to it,\u201d Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and its longest-serving member, told me. \u201cI believe the Senate should be independent, not a rubber stamp of any Administration. But this was a wholesale filibuster, completely unprecedented in two hundred years.\u201d On November 21, 2013, the Senate voted, along party lines, to change its rules so that only fifty-one votes were necessary to bring up for a vote a circuit-court or district-court nomination.\nSince then, the Senate votes have cemented Obama\u2019s judicial legacy. With simple majorities, the Senate approved the three D.C. Circuit nominees, who joined a court that has frequently served as a stepping stone to the Supreme Court. (John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Thomas, and Ginsburg all served on the D.C. Circuit.) The confirmed appeals-court nominees include several judges who conform to the Obama paradigm, in that they are all relatively youthful and impeccably credentialled, with indistinct ideological profiles: David Barron, a forty-seven-year-old Harvard Law School professor, and a former law clerk to John Paul Stevens, to the First Circuit; Pamela Harris, a fifty-two-year-old Georgetown law professor and another former Stevens clerk, to the Fourth Circuit; and Michelle Friedland, a San Francisco attorney active in the legal fight for gay rights (and a former clerk to Sandra Day O\u2019Connor), who is forty-two, to the Ninth Circuit. According to statistics compiled by Sheldon Goldman, of the University of Massachusetts, the average age of Obama\u2019s first-term appeals-court nominees was 53.5 years, and 49.4 for his second-term nominees. This predilection for younger nominees was a strategy of Robert Bauer, Obama\u2019s White House counsel, and his successor, Kathryn Ruemmler. The judges are likely to serve for decades, and they constitute a farm team for prospective Supreme Court appointments.\nI asked Senator Reid what role the President played in overcoming the confirmation impasse. \u201cI think he\u2019s been good in the sense that he\u2019s sent some good people,\u201d he replied. In the light of the magnitude of the struggle, Reid\u2019s praise for the President was faint. To Reid, Obama had the easy job of supplying the names. The Democratic Senate did the hard work of turning those nominees into judges.\nObama has stopped pretending that\u00a0he has much respect for Congress. He had minimal tolerance for legislative horse-trading even when he was a legislator. Now, after six years of implacable Republican opposition to everything he has proposed, he sounds fed up.\n\u201cBecause Congress is not working the way it\u2019s supposed to, there\u2019s both pressure on administrative agencies and pressure on the courts to sort through, interpret, and validate or not validate decisions that in a better-functioning democracy would be clearer and less ambiguous,\u201d Obama said.\nHe pointed out that the failure of Congress to pass legislation on climate change and immigration left his Administration with little guidance on how to proceed on those issues. When there is gridlock in Congress, \u201cthe executive branch has to make a whole series of decisions,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat, in turn, puts more burden on the Court to interpret whether the executive actions are within the authority of the President and whether they\u2019re interpreting statutes properly. All of which I think further politicizes the courts.\u201d\nObama could have added to his list of congressional abdications the Halbig case, the challenge to Obamacare now pending in the D.C. Circuit. The lawsuit is based on what amounts to a typographical error. One provision of the Affordable Care Act states that individuals can receive subsidies for insurance purchased on health-care exchanges \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d Sixteen states and the District of Columbia set up their own health-care exchanges; residents of the thirty-four other states must buy their subsidized insurance on exchanges run by the federal government. Throughout the debate over the legislation, and in other parts of the law, it was a given that the subsidies applied to both the state and the federal exchanges. But two Republican-appointed judges on the D.C. Circuit held that the language of the provision meant that subsidies must be withdrawn for the approximately 4.7 million individuals who purchased insurance on the federal exchange. (A Democratic appointee voted to uphold the law.) In a democracy that wasn\u2019t deadlocked, an amendment to the legislation might have provided clarification. Instead, a single phrase in the law has been used as a way to continue the legal war against Obamacare by new means. The confirmation of Obama\u2019s D.C. Circuit appointees increases the law\u2019s prospects for surviving, but the judges\u2019 decision could be appealed to the Supreme Court, where Obama\u2019s agenda faces significant challenges.\nThe subject of voting rights has largely been thrust upon Obama by a conservative judiciary. \u201cYou look at something like the Voting Rights Act, which was uncontroversial from a legal point of view among both Republicans and Democrats ten, fifteen, twenty years ago,\u201d Obama told me. \u201cThe ruling that struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act would have been considered a fairly radical step, but it\u2019s a step that the Supreme Court took.\u201d He was referring to the Shelby County decision, of 2013, which invalidated the portion of the law that required Justice Department review of electoral changes, mostly in Southern states.\nIn response, Obama offered a modulated criticism. As he put it, \u201cThe fact that the Supreme Court didn\u2019t seem to internalize evidence where state election officials or politicians are pretty unabashed in saying we want to keep certain folks from voting, where you have voter-I.D. laws that clearly make it harder for certain folks to vote, despite the fact that there is no actual evidence of fraud\u2014not just a little evidence of fraud but no evidence\u2014as every mathematical assessment, statistical assessment that\u2019s been done shows, it\u2019s a pretext for wanting to shape the franchise for partisan advantage. The fact that that doesn\u2019t seem to have gone into the Court\u2019s reasoning I think makes it an ultimately flawed decision.\u201d\nFor a long time, the Court has moved toward outlawing all forms of racial preference, including affirmative action, and Obama seems accepting, even supportive, of the change. In 1978, in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, the Court rejected the use of racial quotas in graduate-school admissions. Chief Justice Roberts has made the fight against the traditional civil-rights agenda a cornerstone of his tenure. He wrote nearly a decade ago, \u201cIt is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\u201d\nSpecifically, Obama told me that he believes the Constitution permits the use of racial preferences, though only within carefully defined limits. \u201cIt\u2019s legitimate to say that when the government takes race into account it should be subject to some oversight by the courts,\u201d he said. Judicial \u201coversight\u201d of affirmative action has a controversial history. For many decades, starting in the nineteen-thirties, the Court applied \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d to laws that discriminate against racial minorities, and struck down most of them.\nStarting in 1995, though, with Adarand Constructors v. Pena, the Court, in an opinion by Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, began applying \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d to laws that favor racial minorities\u2014viewing affirmative action, in effect, as a form of racial discrimination. O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion drew a stinging dissent from John Paul Stevens. \u201cThere is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInvidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority. Remedial race-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to foster equality in society.\u201d In its embrace of judicial oversight of affirmative action, Obama\u2019s view appears closer to O\u2019Connor\u2019s than to Stevens\u2019s.\nBy 2003, O\u2019Connor had softened her stance somewhat, writing the majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld the use of affirmative action as a means to achieve diversity at the University of Michigan Law School. However, she made clear that she regarded affirmative action as a stopgap. In twenty-five years, she wrote, racial preferences would be neither required nor permissible. Again, Obama seemed to agree with O\u2019Connor, in his grudging support for racial preferences in admissions. He said, \u201cIf the University of Michigan or California decides that there is a value in making sure that folks with different experiences in a classroom will enhance the educational experience of the students, and they do it in a careful way,\u201d the practice should be allowed. Still, he added, \u201cmost of the time the law\u2019s principal job should be as a shield against discrimination, as opposed to a sword to advance a social agenda, because the law is a blunt instrument in these situations.\u201d\nObama reiterated his belief that the biggest issues concerning race are \u201crooted in economics and the legacy of slavery,\u201d which have created \u201cvastly different opportunities for African-Americans and whites.\u201d He went on, \u201cI understand, certainly sitting in this office, that probably the single most important thing I could do for poor black kids is to make sure that they\u2019re getting a good K-through-12 education. And, if they\u2019re coming out of high school well prepared, then they\u2019ll be able to compete for university slots and jobs. And that has more to do with budgets and early-childhood education and stuff that needs to be legislated.\u201d\nI asked the President whether O\u2019Connor\u2019s time line in the Grutter case, now about halfway expired, was accurate. He replied that Justice O\u2019Connor would \u201cbe the first one to acknowledge that twenty-five years was sort of a ballpark figure in her mind.\u201d In any event, he said, progress in racial justice and equality would not come principally from the courts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where politics comes in,\u201d he said.\nThe previous three Presidents who served two terms\u2014George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan\u2014spent their last two years in office with the Senate under the control of the opposition party. Polls suggest that Obama and the Democrats may meet the same fate. The \u201cThurmond rule,\u201d which emerged when Senator Strom Thurmond, of South Carolina, blocked Lyndon Johnson\u2019s attempt to appoint a new Chief Justice near the end of his Presidency, holds that the Senate stops acting on lifetime judicial nominations roughly six months before a Presidential election. Still, Obama\u2019s judicial legacy is not complete. According to statistics compiled by the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy group, Bush, Clinton, and Reagan all saw about twenty per cent of their total judicial appointments confirmed during their final two years in office. If the pattern holds, that would mean the confirmation of about seventy more Obama judges.\nAs Marine One thundered overhead, about to land on the White House lawn and take Obama to a series of political fund-raisers, I asked him if, like William Howard Taft, he entertained thoughts of serving as a judge later in his career. \u201cWhen I got out of law school, I chose not to clerk,\u201d he said. \u201cPartly because I was an older student, but partly because I don\u2019t think I have the temperament to sit in a chamber and write opinions.\u201d But he sounded tempted by the idea.\n\u201cI love the law, intellectually,\u201d Obama went on. \u201cI love nutting out these problems, wrestling with these arguments. I love teaching. I miss the classroom and engaging with students. But I think being a Justice is a little bit too monastic for me. Particularly after having spent six years and what will be eight years in this bubble, I think I need to get outside a little bit more.\u201d\u00a0\u2666\n",

Obama is the 44th President of the United States.\nHis story is the American story \u2014 values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.\nWith a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.\nAfter working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants.\nHe went on to attend law school, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community.\nPresident Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online.\nHe was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009. He and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters, Malia and Sasha.\nLearn more about President Obama's spouse, First Lady Michelle Obama.\nOn December 6, 1923, President Calvin Coolidge took one small step for a President and one huge leap for digital communications at the White House. On this day in history, President Coolidge became the first president to address the American people on broadcast radio.\nIn this week\u2019s address, the President highlighted the good news in the latest jobs report \u2013 that American businesses added 314,000 new jobs in November, making it the tenth month in a row that the private sector has added at least 200,000 new jobs.\nIt\u2019s been a busy week here at the White House. In case you've missed some of our top stories this week, here\u2019s a recap.\n",
