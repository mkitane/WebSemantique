        "text": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[b\u0254\u0281\u02c8do]; Gascon: Bord\u00e8u; Basque: Bordele) is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France.\nThe small municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 239,399 (January 2011),[2] but together with its suburbs and satellite towns Bordeaux forms the 6th-largest metropolitan area in France with a population of 1,140,668 at the January 2011 census.[4] It is the capital of the Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nThe city's nicknames are \"La perle d'Aquitaine\" (The Pearl of Aquitaine), and \"La Belle Endormie\" (Sleeping Beauty) in reference to the old center which had black walls due to pollution. Nowadays, this is not the case. In fact, a part of the city, Le Port de La Lune, was almost completely renovated.\nBordeaux is the world's major wine industry capital. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo\u00a0(fr),[5] while the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5\u00a0billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.[6]\nIn historical times, around 300 BCE it was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, who named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitainian origin. The name Bourde is still the name of a river south of the city.\nIn 107 BCE, the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, an allied Roman tribe, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus was killed in the action.\nThe city fell under Roman rule around 60 BC, its importance lying in the commerce of tin and lead towards Rome. Later it became capital of Roman Aquitaine, flourishing especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century). In 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. Further ravage was brought by the same Vandals in 409, the Visigoths in 414 and the Franks in 498, beginning a period of obscurity for the city.\nIn the late 6th century, the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Circa 585, a certain Gallactorius is cited as count of Bordeaux and fighting the Basques.\nThe city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman in 732, after he had defeated Duke Eudes in the Battle of the River Garonne near Bordeaux and before the former was killed during the Battle of Tours on 10 October. After Duke Eudes's defeat, Aquitaine pledged allegiance formally to the new rising Carolingian dynasty, but still remained out of Frankish central rule until 768 (Duke Waifer defeated). In 736, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion after his father Eudes's death, at which Charles responded by sending an expedition that captured and plundered Bordeaux again, while the Frankish commander didn't retain it for long, since he left south-east to wage war in Narbonnaise.\nIn 778, Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass that very year. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but he was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress or sympathise with a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were meant to keep in check the Basques and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when the latter appeared c. 844 in the region of Bordeaux. In Autumn 845, count Seguin II marched on the Vikings assaulting Bordeaux and Saintes but was captured and put to death. There are no bishops mentioned during the whole 8th century and part of the 9th in Bordeaux.\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine with the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who became, within months of their wedding, King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 was built. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but in the end, after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France which extended its territory. The Ch\u00e2teau Trompette (Trumpet Castle) and the Fort du H\u00e2, built by Charles VII of France, were the symbols of the new domination, which however deprived the city of its richness by halting the wine commerce with England.\nIn 1462, Bordeaux obtained a parliament, but regained importance only in the 16th century when it became the center of the distribution of sugar and slaves from the West Indies along with the traditional wine.[7]\nBordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\nThe 18th century was the golden age of Bordeaux. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he once said: \"take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Baron Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century big-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This happened again during the First World War and again very briefly during the Second World War, when it became clear that Paris would soon fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to Vichy. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese Visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish Border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\nBordeaux's climate is usually classified as an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb); however, the summers tend to be warmer and the winters milder than most areas of similar classification. Substantial summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as Mediterranean.\nWinters are mild because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22\u00a0\u00b0C (70 to 72\u00a0\u00b0F). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1\u00a0\u00b0C (44.8\u00a0\u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter are commonplace, occurring several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7\u00a0\u00b0C (69.3\u00a0\u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3\u00a0\u00b0C (73.9\u00a0\u00b0F).[8]\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-1st century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.[9]\nBordeaux now has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing ch\u00e2teaux and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,[10] Bordeaux produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855: The first growths are:\nBoth red and white wines are made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re. White Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a subregion of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meanwhile however, the global demand for the first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2\u00a0billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry.\nAccess to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost 9 million tons of goods arrive and leave each year.\n(This list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.)\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.[2] The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans, North Africans, Afro-Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Afican and Asian (mostly from China and Vietnam).[citation needed].\nThe built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux,[4] only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\nThe university was created by the archbishop Pey Berland in 1441 and was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution, before reappearing in 1808 with Napoleon I. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).[13] The University of Bordeaux is divided into four:\nBordeaux has numerous public and private schools offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nEngineering schools:\nBusiness and management schools:\nOther:\nBordeaux is classified \"City of Art and History\". The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis (Marquess) de Tourny.\nMain sights include:\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\"Le Jardin Public\" is a park in the heart of the city.\nEurope\u2019s longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117m long and can be lifted vertically up to 53m to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75\u00a0mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research center, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well. Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.[15]\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid Bicycle sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 4\u00a0million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in three hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has 4 tracks and allows trains to pass at 60\u00a0km/h (37\u00a0mph).[16] During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nBordeaux is served by an international airport, A\u00e9roport de Bordeaux M\u00e9rignac, located 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) from the city center in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Tram et Bus de la CUB (TBC). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\nThis network is operated from 5\u00a0am to 1\u00a0am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\nThe 35,000-capacity Stade Chaban-Delmas is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. It was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, both playing at the Stade Chaban-Delmas. Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, currently playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby. Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quai which runs along the Gironde river. On the Quai there is a skatepark divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skatepark is very well maintained by the municipal workers.\nA new stadium will open in 2015 to replace the Chaban-Delmas stadium. It will have a capacity of 42500 people.[17]\nBordeaux is also the home of one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are the current champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250\u00a0m (820\u00a0ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nBordeaux was the birthplace of:\nBordeaux is twinned with:[18]  [19]  [20]\n",

        "text": "A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares,[1] making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. Eighty-nine percent of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \"claret\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and also (in much smaller quantities) ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines (Cr\u00e9mant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or ch\u00e2teaux. There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine.[1]  [2]\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-1st century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.[3]\nIn the 12th century, the popularity of Bordeaux wines in England increased dramatically following the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine.[4] The marriage made the province of Aquitaine part of the Angevin Empire, and thenceforth the wine of Bordeaux was exported to England.[4] At this time, Graves was the principal wine region of Bordeaux, and the principal style was clairet. This accounts for the ubiquity of claret in England. The export of Bordeaux was interrupted by the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between France and England in 1337.[4] By the end of the conflict in 1453 France had repossessed the province, thus taking control of wine production in the region.[4]\nIn the seventeenth century, Dutch traders drained the swampy ground of the M\u00e9doc in order that it could be planted with vines, and this gradually surpassed Graves as the most prestigious region of Bordeaux. Malbec was dominant grape here, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon.[5]\nIn 1855, the ch\u00e2teaux of Bordeaux were classified; this classification remains widely used today. From 1875\u20131892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by Phylloxera infestations.[4] The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.[4]\nThe major reason for the success of winemaking in the Bordeaux region is the excellent environment for growing vines. The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigate the land and provide an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region.[6]\nThese rivers define the main geographical subdivisions of the region:\n\"The right bank\", situated on the right bank of Dordogne, in the northern parts of the region, around the city of Libourne.\nEntre-deux-mers, French for \"between two seas\", the area between the rivers Dordogne and Garonne, in the centre of the region.\nIn Bordeaux the concept of terroir plays a pivotal role in wine production with the top estates aiming to make terroir driven wines that reflect the place they are from, often from grapes collected from a single vineyard.[7] The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well-drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde river. An old adage in Bordeaux is the best estates can \"see the river\" from their vineyards. The majority of land facing riverward is occupied by classified estates.[8]\nRed Bordeaux is generally made from a blend of grapes. Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and rarely Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.[9] Today Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re is rarely used, with Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, being one of the few to still retain Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re vines.\nAs a very broad generalization, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines produced in the M\u00e9doc and the rest of the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Ch\u00e2teaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. This is typically referred to as the \"Bordeaux Blend.\" Merlot tends to predominate in Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top-quality Ch\u00e2teaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.[10]\nWhite Bordeaux is predominantly, and exclusively in the case of the sweet Sauternes, made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. Typical blends are usually 80% S\u00e9millon and 20% Sauvignon blanc. As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of S\u00e9millon and a smaller proportion of Sauvignon blanc. Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac.\nIn the late 1960s S\u00e9millon was the most planted grape in Bordeaux. Since then it has been in constant decline although it still is the most common of Bordeaux's white grapes. Sauvignon blanc's popularity on the other hand has been rising, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white Bordeaux grape in the late 1980s and now being grown in an area more than half the size of that of the lower yielding S\u00e9millon.\nWineries all over the world aspire to making wines in a Bordeaux style. In 1988, a group of American vintners formed The Meritage Association to identify wines made in this way. Although most Meritage wines come from California, there are members of the Meritage Association in 18 states and five other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Mexico.\nThe red grapes in the Bordeaux vineyard are Merlot (62% by area), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and a small amount of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re (1% in total). The white grapes are S\u00e9millon (54% by area), Sauvignon blanc (36%), Muscadelle (7%) and a small amount of Ugni blanc, Colombard and Folle blanche (3% in total).[1] Because of the generally humid Bordeaux climate, a variety of pests can cause a problem for the vigneron. In the past, this was counteracted by the widespread use of pesticides, although the use of natural methods has recently been gaining in popularity. The vines are generally trained in either single or double guyot. Hand-picking is preferred by most of the prestigious ch\u00e2teaux, but machine-harvesting is popular in other places.[11]\nFollowing harvest, the grapes are usually sorted and destemmed before crushing. Crushing was traditionally done by foot, but mechanical crushing is now almost universally used. Chaptalization is permitted, and is fairly common-place. Fermentation then takes place, usually in temperature controlled stainless steel vats. Next the must is pressed and transferred to barriques (in most cases) for a period of ageing (commonly a year). The traditional Bordeaux barrique is an oak barrel with a capacity of 225 litres. At some point between pressing and bottling the wine will be blended. This is an integral part of the Bordeaux winemaking process, as scarcely any Bordeaux wines are varietals; wine from different grape varieties is mixed together, depending on the vintage conditions, so as to produce a wine in the ch\u00e2teau's preferred style. In addition to mixing wine from different grape varieties, wine from different parts of the vineyard is often aged separately, and then blended into either the main or the second wine (or sold off wholesale) according to the judgment of the winemaker. The wine is then bottled and usually undergoes a further period of ageing before it is released for sale.[12]\nThe Bordeaux wine region is divided into subregions including Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol, M\u00e9doc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness:[13]\nRed Bordeaux and Red Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur. Bordeaux winemakers may use the two regional appellations throughout the entire wine region, however approximately half of the Bordeaux vineyard is specifically designated under Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOCs. With the majority of ch\u00e2teaux located on the Right Bank in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, wines are typically Merlot-dominant, often blended with the other classic Bordeaux varieties. There are many small, family-run ch\u00e2teaux, as well as wines blended and sold by wine merchants under commercial brand names. The Bordeaux AOC wines tend to be fruity, with minimal influence of oak, and are produced in a style meant to be drunk young. Bordeaux Superieur AOC wines are produced in the same area, but must follow stricter controls, such as lower yields, and are often aged in oak. For the past 10 years, there has been strong, ongoing investment by the winemakers in both the vineyards and in the cellar, resulting in ever increasing quality. New reforms for the regional appellations were instituted in 2008 by the Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur Winemakers' Association. In 2010, 55% of all Bordeaux wines sold in the world were from Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOCs, with 67% sold in France and 33% exported (+9%), representing 14 bottles consumed per second.[13]  [14]\nRed C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux. Eight appellations are in the hilly outskirts of the region, and produce wines where the blend usually is dominated by Merlot. These wines tend to be intermediate between basic red Bordeaux and the more famous appellations of the left and right bank in both style and quality. However, since none of Bordeaux's stellar names are situated in C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux, prices tend to be moderate. There is no official classification in C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux.[15] In 2007, 14.7% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[13]\nRed Libourne, or \"Right Bank\" wines. Around the city of Libourne, 10 appellations produce wines dominated by Merlot with very little Cabernet Sauvignon, the two most famous being Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol. These wines often have great fruit concentration, softer tannins and are long-lived. Saint-\u00c9milion has an official classification.[16] In 2007, 10.5% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[13]\nRed Graves and M\u00e9doc or \"Left Bank\" wines. North and south of the city of Bordeaux, which are the classic areas, produce wines dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, but often with a significant portion of Merlot. These wines are concentrated, tannic, long-lived and most of them meant to be cellared before drinking. The five First Growths are situated here. There are official classifications for both M\u00e9doc and Graves.[17] In 2007, 17.1% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[13]\nDry white wines. Dry white wines are made throughout the region, using the regional appellation Bordeaux Blanc, often from 100% Sauvignon blanc or a blend dominated by Sauvignon blanc and S\u00e9millon. The Bordeaux Blanc AOC is used for wines made in appellations that only allow red wines. Dry whites from Graves is the most well-known and the only subregion with a classification for dry white wines. The better versions tend to have a significant oak influence. The [18] In 2007, 7.8% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[13]  [14]\nSweet white wines. In several locations and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine is made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by noble rot. The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and where some of the world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighboring Sauternes, on both sides of the Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The regional appellation for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur Blanc.[19] In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[13]  [14]\nThe vast majority of Bordeaux wine is red, with red wine production outnumbering white wine production six to one.[20]\nThere are four different classifications of Bordeaux, covering different parts of the region:[21]  [22]\nThe Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, covering (with one exception) red wines of M\u00e9doc, and sweet wines of Sauternes-Barsac.\nThe 1955 Official Classification of St.-\u00c9milion, which is updated approximately once every ten years, and last in 2006.\nThe 1959 Official Classification of Graves, initially classified in 1953 and revised in 1959.\nThe Cru Bourgeois Classification, which began as an unofficial classification, but came to enjoy official status and was last updated in 2003. However, after various legal turns, the classification was annulled in 2007.[23] As of 2007, plans exist to revive it as an unofficial classification.[24] 78 producers took legal action against the 2003 classification. In September 2010 a new list of Crus Bourgeois was unveiled as a recognition of quality, with a yearly reappraisal. It is no longer a recognized classification.\nThe Cru Artisan Classification was recognized by the European Union in June 1994 and published on January 11, 2006. The classification is to be revised every 10 years. The initial list of 44 Cru Artisans was extended to 50 in 2012. See.[25]\nThe 1855 classification system was made at the request of Emperor Napoleon III for the Exposition Universelle de Paris. This came to be known as the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, which ranked the wines into five categories according to price. The first growth red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), are among the most expensive wines in the world.\nThe first growths are:\nCh\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild, in the appellation Pauillac\nCh\u00e2teau Margaux, in the appellation Margaux\nCh\u00e2teau Latour, in the appellation Pauillac\nCh\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, in the appellation P\u00e9ssac-Leognan\nCh\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, in the appellation Pauillac, promoted from second to first growth in 1973.\nAt the same time, the sweet white wines of Sauternes and Barsac were classified into three categories, with only Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem being classified as a superior first growth.\nIn 1955, St. \u00c9milion AOC were classified into three categories, the highest being Premier Grand Cru Class\u00e9 A with two members:[21]\nCh\u00e2teau Ausone\nCh\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc\nIn the 2012 classification, two more Ch\u00e2teaux became members:\nCh\u00e2teau Ang\u00e9lus\nCh\u00e2teau Pavie\nThere is no official classification applied to Pomerol. However some Pomerol wines, notably Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus and Ch\u00e2teau Le Pin, are often considered as being equivalent to the first growths of the 1855 classification, and often sell for even higher prices.\nBordeaux wine labels generally include:[26]\nClaret (/  \u02c8   k   l   \u00e6r   \u0268   t   / KLARR-\u0259t) is a name primarily used in British English for red Bordeaux wine.\nClaret derives from the French clairet,[27] a now uncommon dark ros\u00e9, which was the most common wine exported from Bordeaux until the 18th century. The name was anglicised to \"claret\" as a result of its widespread consumption in England during the period in the 12th\u201315th centuries that Aquitaine was part of the Angevin Empire (please compare the History section). It is a protected name within the European Union, describing a red Bordeaux wine, accepted after the British wine trade demonstrated over 300 years' usage of the term.[27]\nClaret is occasionally used in the United States as a semi-generic label for red wine in the style of the Bordeaux, ideally from the same grapes as are permitted in Bordeaux. The French themselves do not use the term, except for export purposes.\nThe meaning of \"claret\" has changed over time to refer to a dry, dark red Bordeaux.[27] It has remained a term associated with the English upper class, and consequently appears on bottles of generic red Bordeaux in an effort to raise their status in the market.\nIn November 2011, the president of the Union des Maisons de N\u00e9goce de Bordeaux, announced an intention to use the term Claret de Bordeaux for wines that are \"light and fruity, easy to drink, in the same style as the original claret when it was prized by the English in former centuries\".[28]\nMany of the top Bordeaux wines are primarily sold as futures contracts, called selling en primeur. Because of the combination of longevity, fairly large production, and an established reputation, Bordeaux wines tend to be the most common wines at wine auctions. The latest market reports released in February 2009 shows that the market has increased in buying power by 128% while the prices have lowered for the very best Bordeaux wines.[29]\nSyndicate des Vins de Bordeaux et Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur is an organization representing the economic interests of 6,700 wine producers in Bordeaux, France. The wine lake and other economic problems have increased the salience of the winemakers' association, whose members are facing increasing costs and decreasing demand for their product.\nAs the largest appellation producing fine wines, and the strong foundation of the pyramid of Bordeaux wines, Bordeaux AOC & Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOC today account for 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.\nPlan Bordeaux is an initiative introduced in 2005 by ONIVINS, the French vintners association, designed to reduce France's wine glut and improve sales. Part of the plan is to uproot 17,000 hectares of the 124,000 hectares of vineyards in Bordeaux.[30] The wine industry in Bordeaux has been experiencing economic problems in the face of strong international competition from New World wines and declining wine consumption in France.[31]\nIn 2004, exports to the U.S. plummeted 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from Australia than from France. Amongst the possible causes for this economic crisis are that many consumers tend to prefer wine labels that state the variety of grape from which the wine is made, and often find the required French AOC labels difficult to understand.\nChristian Delpeuch, president emeritus of Plan Bordeaux hoped to reduce production, improve quality, and sell more wine in the United States. However, two years after the beginning of the program, Mr Delpeuch[32] resigned, \"citing the failure of the French government to address properly the wine crisis in Bordeaux.\" Delpeuch told journalists assembled at the Bordeaux Press Club \u201cI refuse to countenance this continual putting off of decisions which can only end in failure.\u201d[32] \"Delpeuch said he was shocked and disappointed by the failure of his efforts\u2014and by the lack of co-operation from winemakers and n\u00e9gociants themselves\u2014to achieve anything concrete in terms of reforms to the Bordeaux wine industry over the last 24 months.\"[32] The future of Plan Bordeaux is uncertain.\nBurgundy wine\nGlobalization of wine\nJudgment of Paris\nEchikson, William.

Burdeos es, despu\u00e9s de Par\u00eds, la ciudad francesa con m\u00e1s monumentos hist\u00f3ricos protegidos. Fue un centro de intercambios culturales a lo largo de m\u00e1s dos milenios, sobre todo a partir del siglo XII, \u00e9poca en la que se estrecharon sus v\u00ednculos con la Gran Breta\u00f1a y los Pa\u00edses Bajos. El trazado urbano y los conjuntos de edificios construidos desde principios del siglo XVIII no s\u00f3lo hacen de esta ciudad un ejemplo excepcional de la arquitectura neocl\u00e1sica, sino que adem\u00e1s le confieren una coherencia y unidad extraordinarias. El urbanismo de Burdeos refleja el triunfo de los ideales de los fil\u00f3sofos del Siglo de las Luces, que aspiraban a hacer de las ciudades verdaderos crisoles del humanismo, la universalidad y la cultura.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBordeaux, de haven van de maan, is de bewoonde historische stad, gesticht tijdens de periode van de Verlichting, waarvan de waarden tot de eerste helft van de 20e eeuw invloed hadden. De havenstad heeft meer beschermde gebouwen dan enige andere Franse stad, behalve Parijs. Bordeaux wordt gewaardeerd vanwege zijn historische rol als uitwisselingsplaats van culturele waarden gedurende meer dan 2.000 jaar, met name sinds de 12e eeuw dankzij commerci\u00eble banden met Groot-Brittanni\u00eb en de Lage Landen. Het stadsontwerp weerspiegelt het succes van filosofen die steden wilden veranderen in smeltkroezen van humanisme, universaliteit en cultuur.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSource: unesco.nl\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Criterion (ii): Bordeaux, Port of the Moon, constitutes an exceptional testimony to the exchange of human values over more than two thousand years.

The different stages of construction and development of the harbour town are legible in its urban plan, especially the big transformations carried out from the early 18th century onwards.\n  Criterion (iv): Bordeaux, Port of the Moon, represents an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble, created in the Age of Enlightenment, whose values have continued up to the first half of the 20th century. Bordeaux is exceptional in the unity of its urban and architectural classical and neo-classical expression, which has not undergone any stylistic rupture over more than two centuries. Its urban form represents the success of philosophers who wanted to make towns into melting pots of humanism, universality and culture.\n  Due to its port, the city of Bordeaux has retained its original functions since its creation, as a city of exchange and commerce. Its history is easily legible in its urban plans from the Roman castrum to the 20th century. The city has retained its authenticity in the historic buildings and spaces created in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n  The City of Bordeaux has 347 listed buildings, referred to the law of 31 December 1913. The historic town is protected by the \u201cPlan de sauvegarde et de mise en valeur\u201d (PSMV), approved in 1988 and revised in 1998 and 2002. A buffer zone has been established. Management structures for the protection and conservation of the nominated property include the shared responsibilities of national, regional and local governments. Interventions on buildings declared Monuments historiques (class\u00e9s) must have the support of the Ministry for Culture. Several plans ensure the management and conservation of the property and take into account the following aspects: preserving the historic and heritage character, allowing the controlled evolution of the historic centre, unifying the various planning rules and contributing to the international significance of metropolitan Bordeaux.\n \n  \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHistorical Description\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[in French only] On fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement remonter les origines de Bordeaux au IIIe si\u00e8cle av. J.-C., \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la fondation de Lut\u00e8ce. Son \u00e9tablissement sous le nom de Burdigala serait le fait des tribus celtes des Bituriges. Il reste relativement peu de vestiges arch\u00e9ologiques de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode, mais on sait que l'on y importait de l'\u00e9tain depuis la Grande-Bretagne d\u00e8s l'\u00e2ge du Bronze, au d\u00e9but du premier mill\u00e9naire avant J.-C. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9e par les Romains en 56 av. J.-C., Burdigala se d\u00e9veloppa autour de son port, devenant une ville marchande, et conserva cette fonction pendant les si\u00e8cles qui suivirent. Elle poss\u00e9dait aussi d\u00e9j\u00e0 une universit\u00e9 d\u00e8s 286 apr. J.-C.\nAu d\u00e9but du Moyen \u00c2ge, le site de Bordeaux fut victime de plusieurs invasions, des Vandales, des Wisigoths et des Francs, par exemple. La ville fut conquise par les Carolingiens au VIIIe si\u00e8cle. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque appara\u00eet aussi le nom de Seguin, premier comte carolingien de Bordeaux, nomm\u00e9 par le roi. En 848, la ville fut d\u00e9truite par les Normands et la population massacr\u00e9e.\n  \u00c0 partir de 1154 et pendant les trois si\u00e8cles qui suivirent, suite \u00e0 l'union des possessions d'Ali\u00e9nor (duch\u00e9 d'Aquitaine, comt\u00e9 de Poitiers) et de Henry Plantagen\u00eat (duch\u00e9s de Normandie, d'Anjou, du Maine et de la Touraine), Bordeaux fut rattach\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Angleterre. En 1214, les bourgeois de Bordeaux furent exon\u00e9r\u00e9s d'imp\u00f4ts sur leurs vins. Au XIIIe si\u00e8cle, Bordeaux commen\u00e7a \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper ses premi\u00e8res institutions municipales, entra\u00eenant la fondation de la municipalit\u00e9 de Bordeaux en 1253.\n  Au XIVe si\u00e8cle, Bordeaux \u00e9tait un important centre politique et la capitale d'un vaste territoire. Au XVe si\u00e8cle, suite aux conflits entre la France et l'Angleterre, elle dut se d\u00e9fendre contre les Fran\u00e7ais mais fut finalement conquise en 1453 par l'arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise men\u00e9e par le roi Charles VII. Dans les si\u00e8cles qui suivirent, l'\u00e9conomie de la ville faiblit du fait de la perte de l'important march\u00e9 anglais. Aux XVIe et XVIIe si\u00e8cles, l'\u00e9conomie reprit des forces, mais les droits des citoyens furent progressivement amoindris sous la f\u00e9rule royale, ce qui suscita une certaine opposition.\n  Au XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, Bordeaux \u00e9tait le si\u00e8ge de diverses institutions d'importance, parmi lesquelles le parlement, le gouvernement militaire, l'administration, l'universit\u00e9 et d'autres, bien au-del\u00e0 de ses r\u00e9els besoins. La Chambre de commerce y fut \u00e9tablie en 1705, et l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts en 1712, favorisant la reprise \u00e9conomique et le renouveau intellectuel. Durant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise et dans les d\u00e9cennies suivantes, Bordeaux suivit de pr\u00e8s l'\u00e9volution politique des affaires.\n  \u00c0 la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle, Bordeaux \u00e9tait devenue une m\u00e9tropole r\u00e9gionale. Pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale, elle fut choisie pour \u00eatre l'une des bases militaires fran\u00e7aises. Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, elle fut occup\u00e9e par l'arm\u00e9e allemande de 1940 \u00e0 1944, mais ne subit pas de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts graves.\n Source: Advisory Body Evaluation \n  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\tMedia\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBordeaux, Port of the Moon (UNESCO/NHK)  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

        "text": "You'll be raising your glass many times in Bordeaux, which is renowned for its wines, considered amongst the best in the world. As the capital of the department Gironde in the region Aquitaine, it has one million inhabitants in its metropolitan area at a 2008 estimate. After years of neglect, the former wet docks are the country's new hot spot, with a number of caf\u00e9s, gardens, and museums springing up all the time. A lively university community of over 60,000, (Bordeaux Campus is the largest in France) establishes that Bordeaux is about more than just wine. \nBordeaux is considered a very tolerant and relaxed place - no one will bother you about your political beliefs, religion, or sexual orientation. The cultural, artistic, and music scenes are very vibrant. The city was ruled by the English for a long time, which is why Bordeaux seems to have an \"English flair\". \nBordeaux is often referred to as \"Little Paris\" and the rivalry between the \"Bordelais\" (people from Bordeaux) and \"Parisiens\" is a hot subject, so you may experience some heated arguments on the subject during your stay. \nBordeaux is a flat city, built on the banks of the Garonne River. It is also the largest French city by area and geographically one of the largest in Europe. The Garonne merges a dozen kilometers below the city with another river, the Dordogne River to form the Gironde Estuary, which is biggest estuary in France. \nThe city center is located west and south of the Garonne. To the east are a few hills - the only ones in the vicinity. These hills mark the beginning of an industrial zone and suburbs. Because it is a flat city, bicycles make excellent modes of transport, especially as the city has more than 580 km of cycle tracks. Bordeaux is among the most economically dynamic cities in France. \nDue to the weakness of the subsoil, there are no skyscrapers in Bordeaux, which explains its sprawl. The center of the town has retained its traditional stone mansions and smart terraces, hence the reason behind the city being called \"Little Paris\". \nModern buildings can be found to the west (administrative center) and south (university) of the city. \nBordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport (IATA: BOD) (ICAO: LFBD), [1] is west of the city. It is a regional airport which serves mostly domestic flights, though there are international flights as well connecting Bordeaux to some European \"hub\" airports like Paris (Orly and Roissy), London (Gatwick and Luton), Madrid, and Amsterdam. \nAn express bus runs every 45 minutes to the city center, with stops on the demand. The same bus runs from Gare Saint Jean to the airport with three stops: \nThe fare is 7\u20ac, but a reduced fare for those under 26 or over 60 is available for 6\u20ac. \nYou can also take public transit (1.40\u20ac) from the airport to downtown. After you exit the airport \"Arrivals\" section, walk to the right and you will see a bus stop for route Number 1. This bus will take you directly to Gambetta (a short walk from the Hotel de Ville), or you can get off at \"Lyc\u00e9e M\u00e9rignac\" and take tramline A to the city centre. \nThe main train station (Gare Saint Jean) is located about 4km from the center of town. Several trains per day (around one every two hours) go north (to Paris, about 3 hours, 25 trains a day , Angoul\u00eame, Poitiers), south (to Toulouse, Marseille, Montpellier (about 4 to 5 hours), up to Nice), and east (to P\u00e9rigueux and Clermont-Ferrand). \nBuses, trams and taxis leave from in-front of the station. Take Tram C to get to downtown if you are going to the more northern part, or a bus if you are going to the area around Place de la Victoire. \nYou can reach Bordeaux by car from the north (taking the A10 highway or N10), south (taking the A63 highway), and east. A beltway goes around the city. \nIf possible, avoid driving between 8-10AM and 4-7PM, as the beltway is usually overcrowded. \nLong-distance buses seem to stop southeast of the train station along Rue des Terres de Borde by the rental car parking lots. Eurolines [2] provide bus service to the city -- confirm the location of the stop on your tickets and with the somewhat surly staff at the Eurolines ticket sales office (across the street from the main entrance of Gare Saint-Jean). \nIf you're travelling with bikes European Bike Express [3] run a route from north of Leeds, stopping through the UK to Dover and then on towards Bayonne via Bordeaux. Passengers normally travel from the UK to Europe. \nTaxi providers offer service to and from the airport. For taxi services, you can go directly to Bordeaux Airport taxi rank or make an advance booking with one of the companies. \nBordeaux is quite a big city; however, most of the interesting attractions are in the town center. It is not recommended that visitors drive as it is always a hassle to park (and car parks are expensive), and there are often traffic jams in the narrow, old streets of the city. \nThe most interesting way to explore the city is by walking. As most of the town center is a 'pedestrian area', this is easy to do. If you like sports, you can rent roller-skates or a bike (see below) or you can make your way in town using the various bus lines. A small ferry boat permits to go from the western shore of the river to the eastern shore, and vice-versa. \nThree efficient tramway lines are also available (A, B, and C), tickets cost 1.50\u20ac and covers unlimited journeys within one hour of validation. The machines do not accept notes so you will need a French Carte Bancaire or coins.   \nThe bus network is organized around a few main places, where it is possible to take buses to almost every destination in the city\u00a0: \n Gare Saint-Jean (railway station, bus lines going to town center, university, and north of town, TBC agency), \n Place de la Victoire (bus lines going to town center, to the railway station, to the University, north and south-west of town, \n Place Gambetta (bus lines going to la Victoire, the railway station, west, north-west, north of town, TBC agency ). \n Quinconces (TBC agency). \n Single fare tickets (1.50 \u20ac) can be purchased from the driver on the bus although you shouldn't expect to receive change. The best thing to do is buy packages of 5/10 tickets for 5.90/11.30\u20ac or a daily/weekly pass for 4.30/11.30\u20ac from TBC Agencies (French: Espace TBC) at Gare Saint-Jean, Gambetta and Quinconces, all trips are good for one hour of unlimited transfers - you must validate your ticket each time you change buses/trams. You can also purchase these tickets from the automated machines at the tramway stops, all machines will accept coins and some of them will accept chip debit/credit cards. To qualify for the reduced student price of 6.30\u20ac for 10 trips you need to be a student IN Bordeaux and purchase an ID card (July 2010). \nIf you are driving a car note that TBC offers parking (called Parc-relais) included in the fare at specific tram stations. [4] \nAvoid the buses on peak hours (8-10AM, 4-7PM) as the town center is usually totally jammed (and cars often block bus tracks), and buses are overcrowded. \nLe Bus du Fleuve, as it is called, links the western and eastern parts of the city by a small cruise on the river. It is managed by the CGFTE, and you can therefore ride the ferry using a standard bus ticket. The bus goes from the Southern part of Quai Richelieu to the Place Aristide Briand, very close to the Aquitaine Bridge (one of the must-see in Bordeaux). \nA new tramway [5] serves the town, crossing the Garonne via the Pont de Pierre. A distinctive feature of the tramway is that within the inner city, it has no overhead wires as it utilizes ground-level power supply system. \nThe electric bus, called la navette du centre-ville, is the only public transportation on pedestrian roads. There are no bus stops for this one: to board an electric bus, wave your hand to the driver - he will stop the bus and let you on. When you want to go out, just tell the driver. \nAll the maps, fares and times are on the TBC Web site (in French) [6]. Also, maps and times can be easily accessed with Google Maps, just select route \"By public transit\" when getting directions. \nAs was mentioned previously Bordeaux is very flat and has lots of bike lanes so it is very easy to get around the city by bicycle. The city has recently (February 2010) added a city-wide bike sharing program called VCUB [7](similar to V\u00e9lib in Paris), it is a cheap and easy way to see the city although the requirement to put down a 200\u20ac deposit before taking a bike might cause problems if you do not have a bank/credit card that works well with the system. A daily or weekly subscription is 1 or 5\u20ac, respectively and each usage is free provided you do not go over 30 minutes (you can just return the bike and take out a new one). \nBordeaux is a historic city with many tourist attractions. The main districts are briefly presented here, which are listed according to their distance from the railway station. \n Les Quais\u2014 Great for going for a nice walk on the shores of the Garonne, enjoying a ride on a ferry boat, viewing a stunning landscape over the bridges of Bordeaux, or dancing the night away in the city's many nightclubs.  The Aquitaine Bridge is an architectural achievement unique in France. \n The Jacques-Chaban-Delmas lift bridge\u00a0; located between the \"Quais\" and the \"Aquitaine bridge\". Opened in 2013, it features a liftable deck, which goes up to 53 meters (170 ft), to enable cruise ships and historical sailboats to dock close to the Quinconces Square. \n La Victoire\u2014 Historical monuments meet student life and bars. \n The Pedestrian Center \u2014 If you plan on shopping, or are looking for cultural activities, Bordeaux has a lot to offer - and it starts right here. \n Gambetta Square \u2014 The rich districts of Bordeaux start north - this part of the town is nicknamed \"Little Paris\". \n Quinconces Square \u2014 Be sure to check out the fountain monument to the Girondins, a group of moderate, bourgeois National Assembly deputies during the French Revolution.. \n Meriadeck \u2014 The administrative center of Bordeaux, with one of the biggest libraries in France. \n Do not miss the Victory Arch (Roman architecture), at the center of La Victoire and a great example of the town's Roman roots. \n Relax and take a picnic in the lush Public Gardens, north of Gambetta square. \n The Girondins memorial on the Quinconces square is a fitting tribute to the Members of Parliament from Gironde who were guillotined by Robespierre.  \n Musee D'Art Contemporain at 7, rue Ferr\u00e8re. Definitely worth a visit if you are interested in Modern Art. The Richard Long slate line-up on the roof is a permanent feature. Exhibits are always changing and the museum is an inspiring place for installations. The CAPC is open Tuesday to Sunday 11AM-6PM (to 8PM Wednesday), closed Monday; admission is \u20ac5.50 (\u00a34), but free on the first Sunday of the month. \n Musee D'Aquitaine, 20, cours Pasteur. Stunning museum that exhibits Gallo-Roman statues and relics dating back 25,000 years. Hours- 11AM - 6PM Tue-Sun. Free entry for permanent collections; temporary exhibits cost around \u20ac5 for adults. \n Have a walk along the Sainte-Catherine street in the Pedestrian Center and enjoy the scenery. \n Consider crossing the bridges or taking the ferry boat over the river (see Les Quais). \n Climb the 243 steps of the tower of Saint-Michel, and enjoy the panoramic view of Bordeaux (entrance 5 Euro - free for EU nationals under 26). \n Spend some time at the miroir d'eau (water mirror) at the border of the river. Every now and then, it is filled with 2 cm of water, alternated with a cloud of mist. \n Have a drink and a dance at one of the many bars or clubs in Les Quais or La Victoire. \n Watch the ducks play in the big public park north of the center and escape from the city at the Jardin Botanique, Bordeaux's Botanical Garden. Around since 1855, the botanical  garden is the perfect place to take a walk around its many paths, or just sit and relax. Guided tours are on offer, as well as occasional workshops and activities for children. \n Bordeaux gardens open: end March to end October - 8AM to 8PM; end October to end March - 8AM to 6PM. Bordeaux gardens admission is free. \n Fly a jet fighter [8]. You can fly the L39 Albatros from Bordeaux International Airport. Starts at \u20ac1950. \nMus\u00e9e du Vin et du N\u00e9goce, 41 rue Borie 333000 Bordeaux (down a narrow street, tram stop: Chartrons), \u260e 0556901913, [9]. 10am-6pm. The petit Museum of Bordeaux Wine and Trade takes place in the building of a old wine merchant. Visitors can discover the history of the wine trade with artifacts, videos and a guided tour (by reservation) followed by a personal wine tasting and presentation of wines of the region by one of the multilingual staff. 5-7 euros. \u00a0edit \nFootball (soccer) is a very popular sport in Bordeaux, as the F.C. Girondins, the football club, is one of the best in France (avoid talking football in the city, it's another sensitive subject). Tickets for almost every game are easy to come by and can be purchased before the match at the ticket office 'Place Johnstone' at the South West corner of the stadium or on the evening of the game at the turnstiles. Games against main rivals Marseille will sell out well in advance as will the fixtures against PSG, Lyon and usually St Etienne so don't travel without a ticket for one of these games. Expect to pay anything between 9 euros for the Virages Nord and Sud (behind the goals) to a maximum of 80 euros for the exclusive Presidential Suite. \nThe Virage Sud is an amazing experience for any football fan but be warned that everyone stands up on the seats, your view may be restricted by an impressive array of flags and they have a habit of lighting flares frequently during the match. \nDespite the locals being extremely loud and passionate in their support, there are very few safety problems helped partially by the small numbers of travelling fans. In the past few seasons, there have been some clashes against supporters of Marseille and PSG but the vast majority of games end peacefully with both sets of fans mixing on the tram back to the city. \nExplore the city on wheels as Bordeaux is a very nice city for practising roller-skating (or roller-blading) and other \"skating sports\". \nOther sports that enjoy some support in Bordeaux include ice hockey, handball and rugby. The two Bordeaux rugby clubs Stade Bordelais and Begles merged in 2006 to form Union CABBG. The club plays in the second tier of Frances national leagues and usually plays its home games and Stade Andre Moga in the suburb of Begles. Tickets for the seated stands are 10 euros. \nBordeaux Cricket Club are the vice champions of France and play regularly at Ch\u00e2teau Giscours in M\u00e9doc. Attendance is free and greatly encouraged. \nTouring the vineyards and sampling the local wines are one of the greatest pleasures when visiting Bordeaux. It is the second largest wine-growing region in the world and produces over 800 million bottles annually. It produces some of the best and most prestigious wines in the world, some of the most famous being: \nCh\u00e2teau Haut Brion \nCh\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild \nCh\u00e2teau Latour \nCh\u00e2teau Margaux \nCh\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild \nCh\u00e2teau Ausone \nCh\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc \nCh\u00e2teau Grand Renouil \nCh\u00e2teau du Pavillon \nCh\u00e2teau Petrus \nTours are available through many operators. Alternately, call ahead for reservations. Note that Haut Brion and Mouton are closed for renovation in 2010, while Latour generally only accepts serious collectors and professionals. \nIf you are an individual you can take daily wine tours departing from Bordeaux and that head towards all the major vineyards of the region: Canon Fronsac,Saint Emilion, The M\u00e9doc, Graves and Sauternes... The excursions take place on board 8-seater fully equipped minivans and are taken care of by professional driver guides. \nThe annual summer wine festivals are held in tandem with the \"Bordeaux-f\u00eate-le-fleuve\" [10] celebrating the river, land, and international community. The most recent was held on 24-27 June 2010. \nThere are many tour operators for this region of France. They can organise your complete tour (including travel to and from Bordeaux and France) or they can arrange visits to wineries and ch\u00e2teau for you. \nBordeaux is a great city for learning- to learn a bit about French culture, consider visiting cinemas such as Utopia [11] or going to the city library in Meriadeck. \nIf you're interested in wine, don't hesitate to visit wine resellers north of Gambetta or Les Quinconces. \nThe Bordeaux University [12], located a few kilometers south of town, offers a wide variety of courses, from science to humanities, from beginner classes to high-level research. The laboratories are among the best in France. It is possible to take French courses there in the summer, with Erasmus students. The DEFLE [13] (Department for the study of French as a foreign language) is attached to Universit\u00e9 Michel de Montaigne - Bordeaux III. It offers both semester and vacation courses in French for foreign students. \n Franglish, \u260e (0)7 60 47 30 20 (bordeaux@franglish.eu), [14]. French/English Language Exchange event in France and in the UK, every week in some of the best venues across Bordeaux. Practice your French while having a good time meeting locals. Discover the format of 14 minutes one-to-one conversations (7min in French, 7 min in English).  \u00a0edit Website FRANGLISH \nThere are many different jobs available in Bordeaux which can primarily be seen through http://www.indeed.co.uk/jobs-in-Bordeaux. \nBordeaux has made its wealth out of trade, and the local economic system relies heavily on shops and trading halls. The Pedestrian Center is basically full of stores of all kinds, from clothes to art, craftworks, food and wine etc. If you're looking for luxury items, head to Gambetta square and its surroundings. \nDon't hesitate to buy some local music - Bordeaux music groups are on the rise! Check out Kap Bambino, an electronic music duo formed by singer Caroline Martial and beat-smith boyfriend Orion Bouvier. \nClothing is less expensive than Paris, so wear comfortable shoes and head to Rue Sainte Catherine, the longest pedestrian precinct in Europe and the best place for shopping. For some cheap second-hand and vintage clothes, check out a shop called \"Kilo Chic\" on 40 Cours de la Somme.  There are also a few AMOS second-hand stores in the city that offer a nice selection of second-hand and vintage stuff. \nOf course, you can hardly leave Bordeaux, without taking home some of its beloved wine. Make sure you're aware of the customs rules at the airport. \nGastronomy has a very important place in the city, which is full of restaurants of all kinds. French restaurants provide dishes from almost every part of the country, and there are a lot of Asian, African or Arabian restaurants. Generally, walking along Rue de Saint Remi is very suggested. It is officially the street of restaurants of Bordeaux, ending from one side to Miroir de l'eau and to other side to Saint Catherine Street. So, very close to  the most touristic parts of city and easy to reach by tram. \n Cafe du Port, 1, quail Deschamps, \u260e 05 56 77 81 18. It's dining with the ultimate view, the Left Bank on one side and the Pont de Pierre on the other. But it's not just the views that draw customers here in droves, the food's pretty good too. Especially consideing that the chef is the famed Phillipe Techoire. Under his command, you'll feast on beef rib roast, glass eye, and in the winter, roast pig's feet with mustard. Enjoy! A la carte 35\u20ac. \u00a0edit \n Cassolette Cafe, 20 Place de la Victoire, \u260e 05 56 92 94 96, [15]. Well priced and hearty food. Tick your items off on the menu placemat.

The first growths Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild, Chateau Latour, Ch\u00e2teau Margaux and Chateau Mouton Rothschild are all located in the Medoc. If you are planning a tour to a chateau, keep the following in mind: (1) call ahead and make a reservation; (2) Chateau Latour generally only accepts serious collectors and professionals; and (3) Chateau Mouton Rothschild is closed for renovation during 2010, the chai is a five-meter hole as of this writing. \n West: To the west, you will end up at the Atlantic Ocean, with over 250 kilometers of golden sand beaches accompanied by a sea of unspoilt pine forests; there are a lot of very nice-looking little towns close to the sea, including Arcachon, sea-side town, noted for its oyster production. You can take a train from Gare de Saint Jean in Bordeaux to Arcachon for around 7 euros, the train takes between 40 and 50 minutes. The Hourtins' Lake, the biggest fresh water water lake in France, is located there. In summer, its a paradise to go swimming or cycling in the pine-tree woods of that area. Near Arcachon is the biggest sand dune in Europe\u2013 very interesting, especially when you travel with small children. \n East: Here you will find Saint Emilion, a well known AOC (c.f. Saint-\u00c9milion AOC) surrounding the UNESCO Heritage village by the same name (c.f. UNESCO World Heritage List). Here, the most famous chateau are Ch\u00e2teau Ausone and Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc. Nearby, in the Pomerol AOC, lies Ch\u00e2teau Petrus. In addition, the Entre-deux-Mers between the Garonne river and the Dordogne river has a large variety of old castles and wineries that produce Bordeaux Superieur wines. \n South: The Graves region, which includes some of the oldest vineyards.  Two famous estates are Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion (closed for renovation in 2010) and Ch\u00e2teau La Mission Haut-Brion.  To the southeast lies Sauternes, which produces one of the most famous dessert wines in the world, Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem. This area is the most interesting for historical tourism, with many beautiful towns and historical monuments open to the public. Towns: Bazas, Saint Macaire, Uzeste,Cadillac. Castles: Chateau de Roquetaillade [26], Villandraut ,Malle, Fargues, Cazeneuve. \nTo reach those places, you can use either the regional railways (TER) or inter-city bus lines (which often go where trains do not). By car, all these areas are less than an hour from Bordeaux. \nThe whole region is covered with well organized bike or walking trails which let you discover the countryside. \n",

        "text": "Bordeaux, in the south-west of France, needs little introduction to anyone with an interest in wine. One of the world's most prolific wine regions, it also manages to rank among the most famous and prestigious. The secrets of Bordeaux's wine success (other than magical Bordeaux Blend) are its three trump cards: diversity, quality and quantity.\nThe majority of Bordeaux wines are the dry, medium-bodied reds that made the region famous. The finest (and most expensive) of these come from the great chateaux of the Medoc, particularly those in Pauillac and Margaux, and from the \"right bank\" appellations Saint-Emilion and Pomerol. The legendary reds are complemented by high quality white wines, both the dry styles of Pessac-Leognan and the sweet, botrytized nectars of Sauternes. (\u00a9 Wine-Searcher.com)\nThe official Bordeaux viticultural region stretches for 80 miles (130km) inland from the Atlantic coast. It is home to more than 10,000 producers, who turn out a vast quantity of wine each vintage. These range from inexpensive everyday wines through to some of the world\u2019s most expensive and prestigious labels. Bottles of dry red wine produced under the region's generic Bordeaux appellation can be bought for just a few dollars. Those from the top chateaux are regularly traded for several thousand dollars.\nBordeaux's climate is well moderated by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the presence of the various rivers (the Dordogne, the Garonne and the Gironde Estuary into which they flow). The region takes its name (which translates roughly as \"next to the waters\") from the port city of Bordeaux, which serves as its logistical and administrative center. Summer daytime temperatures hover around 77F (25C), and rarely rise above 86F (30C), while winter brings sub-zero temperatures only occasionally. Even the latitude here (45\u00b0N) is moderate: exactly halfway between the equator and the North Pole. The Medoc peninsula feels the maritime influence particularly strongly; local winemakers talk of the gentle breezes and light clouds that take the edge off even the hottest summer days.\nThe region's long, relatively warm summers are ideal for growing late-ripening grape varieties. That is not to say that cool, wet weather in spring and autumn is not a concern here. A fundamental reason that most Bordeaux reds are made from a blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is that these two varieties bud, flower and ripen at different times and rates, which spreads the risk posed by poor weather conditions at flowering or harvest. In years when the autumn is wet, the Cabernet Sauvignon harvest suffers from rot and water-logging, but the earlier-ripening Merlot provides a back-up. When the spring is wet, the Merlot flowers poorly, leaving the Cabernet Sauvignon to take up the responsibility of providing a good harvest.\nThe vast expanse of pine forest to the south (La Foret des Landes) protects Bordeaux from strong, salt-bearing winds coming off the Atlantic Ocean, although there is a risk of still winter air getting trapped and bringing frost to the Bordelais vineyards. The region's proximity to large masses of water, such as the Atlantic Ocean, the Gironde Estuary and the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, helps to moderate climatic extremes.\nMerlot is the dominant red wine grape in the vineyards of Bordeaux, followed closely by Cabernet Sauvignon and then Cabernet Franc. Petit Verdot, Malbec and even Carmenere are also permitted. When used in combination, these varieties are variously referred to as a \"Bordeaux Blend\". Bordeaux's white wines are generally blends of Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and Muscadelle.\nWhile Bordeaux is well regarded for wines produced within specific areas, many of its wines fall under other, far less ambitious appellations. These include Bordeaux, Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur\u00a0and the sparkling-specific Cr\u00e9mant de Bordeaux. Bordeaux also has a distinct and historically significant classification system, which has remained largely unchanged since the middle of the 19th Century.\nFew regions can rival Bordeaux in terms of its impact on the wine world. The few contenders include Burgundy, Champagne, Rioja, Chianti and the Napa Valley.\n",
